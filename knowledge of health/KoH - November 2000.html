			<div style="clear: both;"></div><p style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);" class="Title"><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I was perfectly healthy until.."</span></span> </p>  <p><span class="reading">"..until I was in that car accident"<br>"..until I fell  and broke a bone and then everything went bad"<br>"..until my husband died, then  I never regained my health."<br>"..until I lost my job." </span> </p> <p class="reading">What's the trigger between stressful events and unexplained,  prolonged, declining health?  </p> <p class="reading">Few
recognize that humans have a built-in defense mechanism that can work
in reverse. When faced with a sudden threat to life, such as a
ferocious animal let's say, we have to have instant energy to flee from
it. A perceived threat instantly thrusts stress hormones from the
adrenal glands into our blood stream which immediately increases blood
sugar and circulating fat levels, giving us a tremendous, albeit
temporary, boost of energy. The heart pounds to rush the hormones
throughout the system. For a brief moment or two, we have enough energy
to shinny up a tree and remove ourselves from the threatening
situation. Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't have the ability to
leap into a tree to avoid danger. </p> <p class="reading">The problem
is, when we are under chronic stress, we can trigger this defensive
mechanism. Cholesterol and blood sugar levels rise. As the adrenal
glands, located on top of the kidneys, secrete stress hormones, other
hormones are unbalanced. The onset of hormonally-related diseases (like
breast and prostate cancer) may eventually follow. </p> <p class="reading">Examine some of the reports linking stress to high cholesterol  and blood sugar.  </p> <p class="reading">In
one documented study, the total cholesterol in one subject increased a
whopping 145 points, from 150 to 295, due to mental stress.
[Circulation 19: April 1959] </p> <p class="reading">A paper written
38 years ago in the Journal of the American Medical Association
analyzed psychological factors among 25 newly-diagnosed diabetics.
Researchers found many were depressed, had recently lost a loved one,
had faced financial losses or loss of employment. Many well-controlled
diabetics, when faced with a loss or stressful event, can no longer
control their blood sugar. Researchers noted the case of a policeman
with a 4-year history of well-controlled diabetes. When told his
15-year old daughter had leukemia, his blood sugar was uncontrollable.
When further blood tests revealed his daughter did not have leukemia
and the diagnosis was mistaken, his blood sugar dropped and could again
be controlled with insulin. (Journal American Medical Assn, July 20,
1963] A more recent study revealed that adults undergoing physical or
emotional stress are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with
diabetes. [Diabetes Care 23: 197-201, 2000] Insulin-resistance, the
inability of insulin to enter cells to create energy, is related to
stress and it is known as a causal factor in prostate and breast
cancer. [European Urology 39: 151-58, 2001] </p> <p class="reading">Briefly examine some of the other links between stress and  disease:  </p> <p class="reading">Stress
interferes with estrogen production in females and can increase their
risk of heart disease. [Wake Forest Univ, March 9, 2001] </p> <p class="reading">Even
though a bacterium (Helicobacter pylori) has been identified as the
organism responsible for gastric ulcers, the link between stress and
ulcers is longstanding. Half of the population is infected with H.
pylori but only a few develop ulcers. The mucus layer of the digestive
tract buffers against disease, but stress can interfere with mucus
production. [Journal American Medical Assn 237: 199, 1999] </p> <p class="reading">Not
all people who are infected with rhinovirus (the virus that causes
colds) actually develop symptoms. When 17 adults were purposely
infected with the cold virus only 12 developed symptoms. Physical or
emotional events were more common among those who developed symptoms.
[Behavioral Medicine 18: 115-20, 1992] </p> <p class="reading">Men who
chronically worry over financial, social or health conditions are more
than twice as likely to develop coronary heart disease as men who are
not chronic worriers. [Circulation 95: 818-24, 1997] </p> <p class="reading"><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">Herpes</b>
infections (genital and oral) are more likely to flare up during
stress. [Psychotherapy Psychosomatics 66: 3-26, 1997; Journal
Behavioral Medicine 8: 249-60, 1985] </p> <p class="reading">Severe stress increases the risk of a relapse of breast cancer  by six times. [Lancet 346: 1194-96, 1995]  </p> <p class="reading">Stress negatively affects wound healing. [Lancet 346: 1194-96,  1995]  </p> <p class="reading">Among
people undergoing treatment for angina (chest pain), 40 percent overall
experienced angina following treatment, but this figure rose to 90
percent among highly-stressed individuals. In other words, stress
over-rode the effect of medications. [Psychosomatic Medicine 61:
834-41, 1999 </p> <p class="reading">The problem: cortisol, an adrenal hormone  </p> <p class="reading">Researchers
have identified cortisol, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, as
problematic in stress-related disease. Take a look at some of the data
linking cortisol with health problems: </p> <p class="reading">Elevated cortisol levels impair memory. [Life Science 58:  475-83, 1996]  </p> <p class="reading">High cortisol levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease.  [Biological Psychiatry 42: 1030-38, 1997]  </p> <p class="reading">Cortisol stunts the immune system. [Science News 152: 350,  1997]  </p> <p class="reading">Patients
with various forms of retinal disease (retinitis pigmentosa) have
elevated cortisol levels. [Ophthalmology times, March 15, 1998] </p> <p class="reading">The
level of cortisol increases by 3 times among patients undergoing
surgery. [Journal Endocrinological Investigation 21: 12-19, 1998] </p> <p class="reading">How to counter cortisol and stress nutritionally  </p> <p class="reading">The
adrenal glands use up about a third of the vitamin C in the body.
Vitamin C appears to be the counter agent to cortisol, one of the major
stress hormones produced by the adrenal glands. [Z Ernahrungswiss 24:
219-30, 1985] As cortisol is released from the adrenal glands, vitamin
C levels also drop in the adrenals. [International Journal Vitamin
Nutrition Research 52: 176-85, 1982] In an animal study, the provision
of high-dose vitamin C "essentially abolished the secretion of stress
hormones" says a University of Alabama report released in 1999. [CNN
August 23, 1999] During periods of high stress, adults may need to take
1000-2000 milligrams of vitamin C every 4 hours, preferably with
bioflavonoids (citrus, grape seed, cranberry, bilberry, quercetin) that
help maintain high vitamin C levels. </p> <p class="reading">Vitamin A
(2500-5000 IU), ginkgo biloba (100-200 mg), acetyl L-carnitine (1500
mg) are other food supplements that have been shown to counter the
adverse effects of cortisol. [Drug Topics, December 8, 1997] </p> <p class="reading">Because
stress hormones block the conversion in the liver of essential omega-3
fats into DHA (docosahaenoic acid) which lines nerve cells throughout
the body, it is important for individuals undergoing prolonged stress
to consume fish-liver oil that has already been converted into DHA.
Look for fish oil products that provide 1000-2000 mg of DHA per day. </p> <p class="reading">Increase laughter  </p> <p class="reading">Laughter
is good medicine. The Bible says "A merry heart doeth good like a
medicine." --King Solomon. Laughter decreases the production of
cortisol. [Clinical Research 36: 435A, 1988] Men who viewed a humorous
videotape were shown to have lower levels of stress hormones in an
experimental study. [FASEB Journal 2: A1570, 1988] So rent a Laurel and
Hardy videotape, and laugh away. We can't avoid stress, but can learn
to control it effects upon the mind and body</p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
