			 	<h1 class="title">Update: Collapse of Conventional Medicine</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><strong>Collapse of Conventional Medicine Update- October 28, 2005- </strong>An
elderly woman called to ask if her fish oil supplement could have
raised her blood pressure somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her pharmacist thinks
so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or it might be the herbal multivitamin she is taking,
but the pharmacist didn’t feel he could sort out all the ingredients in
the herbal-multi to determine exactly what might be causing the
problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;So she called this reporter to ask if I
knew.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her blood pressure rose about the same time she
started taking the fish oil supplement.&nbsp;&nbsp;More inquiry was
made.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which medicines does she take? -a calcium blocker and
a beta blocker.&nbsp;&nbsp;When were these prescribed? – the beta
blocker just a few days ago. She also adds that her ankle is now
swollen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here is a pharmacist questioning an innocent
dietary supplement when it was obvious the beta blocker, which slows
down the heart rate, was causing the ankle swelling and was ineffective
for blood pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly caller has no idea that the
Lancet, a British medical journal, just conducted a wider analysis of
beta blockers and found they are far less effective than previously
reported and certainly don’t decreased the risk for
stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Lancet 366: 1545-53, 2005]&nbsp;&nbsp;Current
guidelines for doctors call for beta blockers as front-line therapy for
hypertension.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature Magazine just finished reporting that
these guidelines are often drafted by physicians who have financial
connections with pharmaceutical companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d bet a few
bucks that beta blockers will remain first-line treatment for
hypertension a year from now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Elsewhere……..In the
same edition, Lancet published reports showing Iressa (gefitinib), an
anti-cancer drug, failed to improve the survival of patients with
non-small cell lung cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Lancet 366: 1507-08, 2005],
while a review of studies conducted in six countries revealed that
cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly reduces the risk for
lung cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring on the broccoli, cabbage and Brussels
sprouts!&nbsp;&nbsp;[Lancet 366: 1558-60, 2005]&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnawing
part of Iressa’s failure is that it was approved by the FDA in May of
2003 for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has failed to
respond to other drugs used to kill cancer cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;By
December 17, 2004 the FDA announced the <em>“failure of a clinical
trial of Iressa (gefitinib) to show an overall survival advantage in
treating patients with lung cancer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It’s a replay of
the previous study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why isn’t this drug abandoned by
oncologists and withdrawn from use by the FDA?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales for
Iressa in the first quarter of 2005 were $81
million.&nbsp;&nbsp;–Copyright 2005 Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health,

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><strong>Knowledge of Health Blog, October 24, 2005</strong>-
Modern medicine continues to fail, to disappoint, and now to anger.
It’s a self-serving industry to the nth degree. It acts with impunity.
No medical board will fix what ails doctoring. No government agency has
the will to remedy the situation, being bought off as the recent Vioxx
scandal revealed. Unsafe drugs are being marketed as <em>“FDA approved.”  </em>Doctors,
the appointed guardians of public health between patients and drug
companies, don’t seem to care. It’s now become obvious that politicians
exert control over governmental health agencies to mandate vaccines and
write drug guidelines to ensure drugs become the sole standard of care.
More people need to opt out of the system, but don’t know which way to
turn given that alternative medicine often has its disappointments and
isn’t covered by insurance plans. <a href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/executelink.asp?story=How%20modern%20medicine%20failed%20Rona">FULL STORY</a><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

it's true, Australian scientists believe "flea protein" may help repair
damaged arteries. They had better come up with something after ignoring
or rejecting decades of research which unequivocally shows vitamin C is
required to repair damaged collagen in artery walls. Flea protein will
do. It's abundant, renewable and cheap. Maybe we could even kill a few
fleas and eat them to strengthen our arteries. It's as good a
substitute for vitamin C as any other of the problematic drugs they've
come up with. Eat fleas! Forget vitamin C! </span></span></div>  <div class="headline"><strong></strong> </div>  <div class="headline"><strong><span style="font-size: 130%;">Flea protein may repair  arteries</span></strong> </div> <b>A protein responsible for fleas' astonishing  jumping power could be harnessed to repair damaged arteries. </b> <p>Scientists
have taken the gene that produces resilin and used it to create a
super-strong rubbery polymer with potential use in surgery. </p> <p>Not
only does it enable fleas to leap prodigious distances, it allows flies
to beat their wings at incredible speed - up to 200 times a second. </p> <div class="bo"> <p>It out-performs even the highest-grade rubber in its ability to withstand  stress and bounces back into shape.  </p><p><b>Very stretchy </b> </p><p>Tests
on strips of the artificial resilin showed it had similar properties -
they could be stretched to more than three times their original length
without breaking. </p><p>They suggested that it could be used to replace similar elastic material in  the walls of damaged arteries.  </p><p>Writing
in Nature, the researchers said: "Resilin resembles cross-linked
elastin in human arteries, which must also survive for the entire
lifetime of the organism." </p><p>Professor Roger Greenhalgh, a
vascular surgeon at Imperial College London, said restoring elasticity
to arteries could potentially combat two forms of cardiovascular
disease. </p><p>Atherosclerosis is a thickening and stiffening of the
arteries, which can reduce blood flow, and eventually trigger a heart

Bush administration is in the final stages of preparing a plan to deal

			 	<h1 class="title">Two Australians Doctors Win 2005 Nobel Prize in Medicine – The Rest of the Story</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div>The
saga of two Australian physicians is indicative of the commercial
influence over the practice of medicine today. Gastric ulcers were long
thought to be caused by excessive stomach acid. Antacids like Tums and
Pepto-Bismol were often prescribed. But in 1982 Dr. Barry Marshall and
Robin Warren, Australian physicians, discovered a bacterium caused
chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers. In 1984 Dr. Marshall intentionally
infected himself, developed an ulcer and cured it with antibiotics to
demonstrate his discovery. It is now firmly established that
Helicobacter pylori causes more than 90% of duodenal ulcers and up to
80% of gastric ulcers.<br><br>In 1984 there was a lot at stake.
Tagamet, a designer antacid, began to be used by physicians from 1974
to 1977. Hundreds of millions of dollars of this drug were being sold.
Prompted by the drug company that sold the antacid, physicians were
slow to change from a prescription antacid to antibiotics. Doctors and
pharmaceutical companies were profiting handsomely. The Tagamet patent
ran out in 1994. That’s exactly when a National Institutes of Health
Consensus Development Conference panel concluded that H pylori plays a
significant role in the development of ulcers and that their
eradication with antibiotics can cure peptic ulcer disease.
[Postgraduate Medicine 102: Nov. 1997] Health authorities had let the

suffered. It was later found that H. pylori also causes gastric cancer.
How many people died of gastric cancer due to H. pylori infection while
the drug company profited is unknown. Public health authorities and
pharmaceutical interests are often in collusion without regard for
public welfare. The recent FDA approval of Vioxx is a more current
example. –Copyright 2005 Bill Sardi<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><strong></strong>  Seventeen  <strong>elderly residents at a nursing home in Canada succumb to Legionnaire's  disease,</strong>
and they blame it on a bacterium. But did this bacterium just show up?
Why didn't the younger staff workers get the disease? Because <strong>older adults have compromised immune systems</strong>.  As evidence,  about 1 in 4 adults over age 80 develop the shingles, which is an eruption of  the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">herpes</b> virus.  <strong>Did the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">herpes</b> virus strike them out of  nowhere?</strong>  No, they had been harboring the <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">herpes</b>
virus for decades, but now it could no longer be kept at bay by the
immune system. The same goes for the Legionnaires' bacterium, which was
named for senior-aged members of the American Legion, most who smoked
and drank alcohol which impair the immune system, and succumbed to an
airborne infection at a hotel where they were attending a convention.
The bacteria and viruses are prevalent. <strong>Strep  is another bacterium that humans harbor in their mouth</strong>
and when mucus lining in the throat isn't adequate, the strep bacteria
dig in and cause a sore throat. All modern medicine can think of is <strong>vaccines to build acquired  immunity</strong> (antibodies), and more and more man-made <strong>antibiotics,  which cause germ resistance</strong>.
The innate immune system (white blood cells, called phagocytes and
natural killer cells) and T-cells from the thymus, can be boosted with
dietary supplements (vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, selenium) and bacteria
and viruses quelled with elderberry, garlic, oregano, olive leaf, etc.
The residents of the Canadian nursing home join the "legions" of people
who have needlessly succumbed to infectious disease while effective
antidotes go unused. -Bill Sardi, Copyright 2005<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			 	<h1 class="title">Spanish Flu Redux</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><p>Stanford
University reports that an estimated 675,000 Americans died of the
Spanish flu in 1918, with a mortality rate of 2.5% versus 0.1% in
previous flu outbreaks. </p>  <p>Andrew Jakomas, a survivor of the
1918 flu epidemic, describes it, "We had little caskets for the little
babies that stretched for four and five blocks. Eight high. Ten high." </p>  <p>Usually
the flu strikes youngsters and the aged. In 1918 a larger percentage
were young adults, age 20-40 years. This is explained by the fact many
young men had returned from WWI infected with tuberculosis in their
lungs, then were infected with the flu virus, and couldn't withstand
the double attack of a bacterium and a virus on their lungs. Of
interest is the unexplained lack of attention U.S. health authorities
are giving to a stealth bacterium that has infected most of the
population without them realizing it, and it is a cousin to TB. It is
paratuberculosis, and it withstands Pasteurization of milk. About 2.5%
of milk cartons in stores harbor this bacterium, which does not cause a
fever, nor raise white blood cell counts, nor do TB tests detect it. If
infected with para-TB and the flu virus at the same time, it may be
difficult for your immune system to withstand such a challenge. <a href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/executelink.asp?story=Spanish%20Flu%20Redux">more....</a></p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			 	<h1 class="title">Don't eat food, it could interfere with your drugs!</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prescription Drugs Can Interact With A Variety Of Foods</span><span id="KonaBody"> <p class="first">Eating
fruits and vegetables is essential to living a long and healthy life,
yet research has shown they can cause dangerous interactions with
medicines. According to the July issue of General Dentistry, the
Academy of General Dentistry's (AGD) clinical, peer-reviewed journal,
foods can increase or decrease the activity and toxicity of
orally-administered drugs (intravenous drugs are not altered).</p></span><span id="KonaBody1"> <p>One
of the most studied of these interactions is the inhibition of CYP3A4
enzymes caused by grapefruit or its juice. CYP3A4 enzymes are
responsible for the metabolism of more than 60 percent of
orally-administered drugs. Drugs that interact with grapefruit include
anti-infectives, anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular agents, central
nervous system agents, estrogens, gastrointestinal agents, Histamine H1
antagonists, immunosuppressives, and erectile dysfunction drugs. Dental
patients in particular should be aware of interactions with the
sedatives triazolam, midazolam and diazepam which could cause excessive
sedation.</p> <p>As little as 6.0 oz of grapefruit juice may lower the
amount of a drug needed to produce the desired effect, which could
cause an overdose. The blood that absorbs nutrients passes through the
liver before reaching the general circulatory system (the first-pass).
The ability of a drug to successfully pass from the GI tract to the
plasma is called its bioavailability. Grapefruit juice inhibits
first-pass drug metabolism, increasing bioavailability.</p> <p>Many
elderly patients vacation or spend winters in southern states such as
Florida , where they may be more likely to consume grapefruit and other
fruits that may interact with prescribed medicines. The components of
grapefruit juice believed to be clinically active are also found in
limes, pumellos, and Seville oranges. Natural food products, citrus
products and cabernet sauvignon wine are also known to interact with
drugs. This interaction can increase the concentration of drugs in the
bloodstream and enhance their potency, which can result in toxicity.</p> <p>While
most people know to ask their pharmacists about possible interactions
between medicines, many don't realize they should also be asking about
the foods in their refrigerator, according to Dennis Flanagan, DDS,
MAGD. He advises that patients use caution because there are probably
more food and beverage interactions that have not yet been discovered.</p> <p>There
are ways to protect against food/drug interactions. Patients should
refrain from grapefruit consumption for 24 to 48 hours before and
during drug therapy, says Dr. Flanagan. He also suggests that
“Patient[s] should read the drug information flyer provided in every
prescribed drug and question their pharmacist. [They] should also be
advised to report any unusual drug effect.” </p></span><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<div style="clear: both;"></div><p>Army helicopters fly over a small American town as a voice barks harshly: "No  one is allowed to leave this town!"</p>  <p>~ A line from the 1995 movie entitled Outbreak</p>  <p>In
the latest version of "art precedes reality," Hollywood predicted a
viral outbreak that would require quarantine of an entire town in
America in the 1995 movie Outbreak starring Dustin Hoffman. In that
movie the virus came from a monkey being smuggled in from Zaire. The
movie was more about the possibility of a virus like Ebola than the
dreaded H5N1 influenza virus that now has the world in the grip of
hysteria. But Outbreak dealt with the mutation of the virus, which
makes it more appropriate for today’s latest viral health threat – a
mutated influenza virus, probably from bird flu. <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi45.html">more...</a> </p> <p align="left"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: 100%;"><a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi45.html"><full></full></a><a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi45.html"><full></full></a><br></span></p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
