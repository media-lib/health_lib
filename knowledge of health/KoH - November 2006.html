investigators have long known that nervous system disorders like
multiple sclerosis occur more frequently in inland areas away from
fish. Now there is compelling data that says fish consumption
signficantly reduces the onset of dementia (Alzheimer's disease).
Researchers at the US Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston report on 899
men and women (avg age 76 years) who were free of mental decline at the
beginning of the study. Out of 899 subjects, 99 developed dementia over
9 years with those subjects who consumed more omega-3 oils from fish
experiencing 43% less risk. The marker used in the study was DHA, aa
component of fish oil. -Annals Neurology Nov. 2006.<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span>They're
at it again, claiming statin drugs are beneficial. The latest review is
a pooled analysis from 7 studies. The 7 trials involved 42,848 patients
who took statin drugs for 4.3 years on average. The researchers claim
statin drugs reduced heart attacks by 29% and strokes by 14%. However,
these are relative numbers. There wasn't a significant reduction in
coronary heart disease mortality (same number of people died). The
absolute (not relative) risk reduction for a heart attack was 1.7%,
meaning 60 patients would need to be treated for an average of 4.3
years to prevent 1 major coronary event. In low-risk patients, the
reduction in major strokes or heart attacks would be 0.75%, with
high-risk patients experiencing a 2.51% reduction. So the relative
difference between low and high risk groups is over 300%, but only an
absolute difference of 1.76%. The researchers speculated if 23 million
Americans took statin drugs about 383,000 heart attacks and 85,800
strokes would be prevented over 5 years, but the same number of people
would die, at a cost of about $40-155 billion for the medication. The
whole report is found in the November 27, 2006 issue of the Archives of
Internal Medicine, volume 166, pages 2307-13. Copyright 2006 Bill Sardi</span><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span>Did
anybody hear about the recent vitamin E analysis? It showed that male
users of vitamin E supplements, and no one else, achieved a blood
concentration of vitamin E that conferred an 18% relative decreased
risk for all causes of death, a 30% decline in risk for death due to
cancer or cardiovascular disease, compared to men whose vitamin E level
was very low. The population studied were males age 50-69 years in
Finland who smoked cigarettes. [American Journal Clinical Nutrition 84:
1200-07, 2006] Extra-high doses of vitamin E were not required to
achieve these reductions in health risks. Only about 100 milligrams of
vitamin E worked and larger doses did not produce a greater effect.
Dietary intake of vitamin E is about 9-11 milligrams per day and the
Recommended Daily Allowance is 15 milligrams per day, which 93-96% of
men and women respectively do not consume. The advantage goes only to
the supplement users. [American Journal Clinical Nutrition 84: 959-60,
2006] </span><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><p>While
federal health authorities announce about 90,000 deaths occur in U.S.
hospitals annually from infections, hospitals outside the U.S.
automatically quarantine patients as they are admitted and quickly
determine if they are resistant to antibiotics. If patients are
antibiotic resistant, then special infection-control measures will be
utilized throughout their hospital stay.<br><br>Testing for
drug-resistant forms of bacteria upon admission and weekly thereafter
has been shown to reduce infection rates in intensive care units by 75%
and in hospital wards by 40% and an overall reduction in drug-resistant
infections by 67%. Other methods of infection control, such as hand
washing, were ineffective. [Clinical Infectious Diseases 43: 971-78,
2006] Where is the Centers for Disease Control? US hospitals are
allowing patients to die needlessly of avoidable infections. A more

urgent re-establishment of circulation to the heart are able to receive
it within the suggested 90-minute time window.<br><br>….After the
90-minute time window, angioplasty may offer no benefit and may
slightly increase the risk of death compared to medical therapy with
blood thinners and clot busters alone.<br><br>….And that wire artery
props (called stents) that are placed into coronary arteries may often
fail due to blood clots forming around the stents or re-narrowing of
the artery despite the placement of the stent. Thousands of Americans
are now dying annually from sudden heart attacks caused by the collapse
or narrowing of the stents themselves.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> &lt;<a href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/executelink.asp?story=US%20hospitals%20are%20not%20prepared%20to%20treat%20fresh%20heart%20attack%20patients">FULL STORY</a>&gt;</span></span></span></span></p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Bill Sardi rebuts a recent letter published by an oncologist in the Britism Medical Journal:<br><br>Why alternative medicine for cancer therapy?   </span> <br>Bill Sardi,<br>Journalist<br>San Dimas, California 91773<br><br>Send response to journal:<br>Re: Why alternative medicine for cancer therapy?<br><br>Dowsing
and flower therapy are certainly an affront to oncologists. But
criticism of alternative cancer therapies fails to address why patients
resort to these poorly if not totally unfounded treatments. Isn't it
because modern medicine has failed to cure cancer and operates under
the guise that it holds scientific high ground? Much cancer treatment
has been disproven, but oncologists attack the unproven. Which has a
better chance of effecting a cure? On the day cancer is diagnosed
30-50% of cancer patients have metastatic cancer, for which there is no
effective treatment. Among the remaining percentage of cancer patients,
most have solid tumors which cannot be penetrated by radiation or
chemotherapy and the latter only works for a time till drug resistance
sets in. Modern medicine has obviously failed to sell cancer patients
on the idea that chemo, radiation or surgical treatment are of much
benefit. We now have expensive gene-targeted drugs that add only a few
months of life to a cancer patient's prognosis. Is it any wonder cancer
patients look elsewhere? - Bill Sardi, President Knowledge of Health,

it's winter, and the season for sniffles and colds. I woke up a few
days ago with a runny nose. Dr. John Cannell's vitamin D cold cure came
to mind. Dr. Cannell captains the Vitamin D Council website. So I began
by taking 15,000 IU of vitamin D. The sniffles subsided. A bit later in
the day the runny nose began to return, so more vitamin D, another
10,000 IU, and the symptoms disappeared once again. I kept taking
vitamin D throughout the day like this and took a hefty 20,000 IU dose
the next morning. Cold was gone. Dr. Cannell advises vitamin D may not
address all the types of viruses that cause colds, so quercetin,
licorice root, vitamin C, resveratrol, oregano, garlic (allicin),
elderberry may be advised as natural remedies, to cover all the bases
when colds strike. But in winter, when vitamin D levels are low due to
lack of sunlight. the first reach should be for vitamin D. Dr. Cannell
advises 50,000 IU for the first three days of a cold. Vitamin D pills
in most stores are limited to 1000 or 2000 IU pills. 5000 IU and 50,000
IU vitamin D capsules are available from LifeSpan Nutrition at <a target="_blank" href="http://webmail.adelphia.net/webedge/do/mail/message/www.lifespannutrition.com">www.lifespannutrition.com</a>   -- Copyright 2006 Bill Sardi</span></span><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			 	<h1 class="title">Why don't doctors prescribe vitamin pills with oral contraceptives?</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica;"><span family="SANSSERIF" pt="" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 85%;" lang="0">The
lifestyle of a young woman who has frequent sexual contacts with
different partners, who takes birth control pills and smokes cigarettes
to avoid the weight gain caused by the oral contraceptives, is all too
common. The risk for transmission of the human papilloma virus that
causes cervical cancer increases with all of the above factors, but
some women who acquire the virus never develop cancer. Researchers now
think they know why.<br><br>Pap smears reveals that women who smoke are
many times more likely to exhibit high viral levels and precancerous
changes in their cervical tissue than nonsmokers. [Cancer Epidemiology
Biomarkers, Oct. 20, 2006 online]<br><br>Doctors at the Karolinska
Institute in Sweden, where the above link between smoking and cervical
cancer was measured, claim that smoking has an enigmatic role in
cervical cancer. Enigmatic means mysterious, unclear, puzzling. The
role of smoking in cervical cancer is not enigmatic.<br><br>Smoking
depletes the body of folic acid and vitamin C to the point where the
immune system is compromised and the papilloma virus takes hold and
years later will cause cancer. An abnormal Pap smear indicates early
trouble and doctors then recommend surgical removal of the tissue, all
which could be avoided with an improved diet and vitamin pills.<br><br>The
Karolinska Institute in Sweden is very prestigious. Yet researchers
there overlooked a report in the Journal of Infectious Disease in 2003
that the risk for papilloma virus infection is related to low vitamin C
levels. [Journal Infectious Disease 188: 1508-16, 2003] More than a
decade ago researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
New York reported that smoking women are more likely to have low
vitamin C levels and pre-cancerous lesions of the cervix. [Cancer
Detection Prevention 15: 165-70, 1991] Similar findings have been made
for low levels of folic acid and papilloma virus infection. [Cancer
Epidemiology Biomarkers 2: 525-30, 1993]<br><br>There are many who
oppose mandatory vaccination against the papilloma virus. There are
others who claim that those who oppose such a vaccine will expose their
children to infection because their children may have sexual contact
with a non-vaccinated partner. Such folly. The papilloma vaccine is
unproven and does not offer protection against all strains of the
papilloma virus. Young women may be at the same risk for cervical
cancer regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not. <br><br>Why
don't doctors prescribe vitamin pills with oral contraceptives?
Vitamins offer protection against all strains of the papilloma virus.
Doctors are subjecting their patients to eventual surgery or cancer by
neglecting the published reports on the link between nutrition and
cervical cancer. Furthermore, vaccine does not confer protection
against all forms of sexually-transmitted disease (<b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">herpes</b>, Chlamydia, others). <br><br>Parents
who accompany their daughters to the doctor's office for their first
prescription for oral contraceptives are giving license to activity
that can be very harmful. The provision of oral contraceptives from
health clinics on college campuses encourages the spread of disease.
Those who espouse sex only in context of marriage and who object to
mandatory papilloma virus vaccination are now ridiculed. What
convoluted thinking. -Copyright 2006 Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health,

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><div><span>So
the American Medical Association doesn't like competition. The AMA
slammed bio-identical hormone therapy, promoted by actress Suzanne
Somers. The AMA says these hormones are unregulated, pose the same
health risks as prescription-drug versions, and need to undergo safety
studies. The battle is between horse-urine (the Rx pharmaceutical
version) and plant-based hormones (bio-identical hormones), between
standard-dose hormones vs individualized hormone therapy.<br><br>This
is a turf battle supreme, the AMA versus one woman. Picking on a female
like Suzanna Somers is a public relations mistake for the AMA. The AMA
says pharmacies compounding bio-identical hormones aren't regulated
enough. The pharmaceutical hormones came from highly regulated
companies and slightly raised mortality rates for breast and other
forms of cancer.<br><br>Some natural-therapy-minded doctors have been
prescribing bio-identical hormones for 20 years. The problem with
hormone therapy has always been dosing. Women as they approach
menopause are a moving target --- their naturally-produced ovarian
hormone levels are slowly declining.<br><br>A standard dose for all
females was the rule until it was found they increase mortality rates.
Modern medicine has left menopausal women in a lurch. Without hormone
therapy their bones wither, their mood declines and many are
inappropriately placed on anti-depressant drugs, and skin/vaginal/eye
dryness is pervasive. For women who don't want to go to doctors for
bio-identical hormones, 1-2 tablespoons of flaxseed meal added to
yogurt or whole grain cereal does wonders. Flaxseed contains lignans,
weak estrogen-like molecules. -Copyright 2006 Bill Sardi, Knowledge of

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div>Drugs
aren't intended to cure and doctors are "lapdogs" to drug companies,
say two outspoken critics of the medical care industry.<br><br>Doctors
must not be 'lapdogs' to drug companies, says Adriane Fugh-Berman,
Associate Professor in Complementary and Alternative Medicine at
Georgetown University.<br>Speaking out in the British Medical Journal,<br><br>Dr.
Fugh-Berman said "Drug representatives are paid to be nice to us as
long as we cooperate, sustaining market share of targeted drugs, and
limiting our continuing medical education lectures to messages that
increase drug sales."<br><br>She claims the drug industry is happy to
play the 'genial uncle' until physicians want to discuss subjects that
are off-limits, such as the benefits of diet or exercise, or the
relationship between medicine and pharmaceutical companies.<br><br>At a
medical meeting, Dr. Fugh-Berman caused pharmaceutical company
representatives to pack up their exhibits and walk out after she
delivered a speech to doctors on how drug companies conduct
psychological profiling and monitoring of physicians, including
prescription tracking.<br><br>In Britain, Ken Eckersley, representing
The Campaign for the Effective Prevention &amp; Treatment of Addiction,
speaking out in a report entitled "Are taxpayer-paid pharmaceutical
drugs worth dying for?" said "more and more prescribed drugs are curing
fewer and fewer illnesses, because of the current psycho-pharmaceutical
policy of disease and addiction 'management' instead of the seeking of
actual cures."<br><br>Eckersley added that "psycho-pharm marketing
chiefs have recognized that every time a patient is cured of his
illness or an addict is cured of his habit, pharmaceutical companies
loses a customer for the drug they have been supplying. As a result, it
was decided that 'treatment' which brings 'relief' or "support" or
which 'manages' the illness or habit essentially throughout the
lifetime of the individual, could be vastly more profitable than
getting rid of the illness or addiction by curing it."<br><br>He went
on to point out that "this ensures the numbers of patients rise year by
year, so that we continuously need more hospital premises, more
equipment, more staff and of course more taxpayer paid drugs - the
proof of which is plain for all to see." -Copyright 2006 Bill Sardi<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<div style="clear: both;"></div>The
Food &amp; Drug Administration has approved Zolinza, a drug to treat
T-cell lymphoma. Zolinza (vorinostat) is a new class of drug that
switches off genes associated with the development of cancer. Other
drugs similar to Zolinza are soon to be approved.<br><br>Zolinza is
different from the gene-targeted drugs like Erbituz and Gleevec that
switch just a few genes. Zolinza switches a multitude of genes. [The
Economist Oct. 12, 2006] Its approval as an “orphan drug” to treat a
less common form of cancer appears to be part of an effort to rescue a
drug giant that is currently on shaky financial ground. [Drug News
&amp; Perspectives 19: 2006]<br><br>According to the National Cancer
Institute, vorinostat (Zolinza) produces side effects, such as diarrhea
(51%), fatigue (51%), nausea (43%), and anorexia (27%), fatigue (7%),
and pulmonary embolism (5.4%). Vorinostat also causes chemical
abnormalities such as high cholesterol (66%), high triglycerides (66%),
and high blood sugar (64%) as well as anemia (54%) low white blood cell
count (24%), and a decline in blood platelets (42%). It is difficult to
ascertain how this drug obtained FDA approval.<br><br>Nature has its
master gene switcher – resveratrol, which has been shown to favorably
trip gene-controlled protein making. [Cancer Biology Therapy 3:882-8,
2004] Dr. John Pezzuto, the pioneering researcher who uncovered
resveratrol’s anti-cancer properties, says resveratrol is a “whiff that
induces a biologically specific tsunami,” referring to its broad
ability to favorably switch thousands of genes. [Cancer Biology Therapy
3:889-90, 2004] In the 35 years of the war on cancer, there has yet to
arise a drug that would rival resveratrol anti-cancer properties. How
many more cancer deaths before resveratrol is employed by oncologists?
