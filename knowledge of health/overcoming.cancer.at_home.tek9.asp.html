</font><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Cancer........what is it?  Such fear
 surrounds it.  Experts say it will never be cured because malignancies 
are caused by so many factors -- viruses, 
inflammation, toxins, poor immunity, etc.  The sole approach to cancer 
treatment is to kill the cancer cell, either by surgical removal or 
toxic 
treatment (chemicals or radiation).  These harsh treatments often lead 
to the demise of the patient before the malignancy produces a mortal 
conclusion. None of the current conventional treatments for cancer 
addresses its cause. Because of this, recurrence rates are high.  Sadly,
 after more than 30 years and billions of dollars of research, the 
cancer mortality rates have not dropped overall.  Some patients, knowing
 this, begin a search on their own 
for alternatives, such as treatments in Mexico, or they hear about 
laetrile (amygdalin, apricot pits), or Essiac tea.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">They are now on an unguided path.  
Told by their doctors that vitamins may interfere with treatment, they 
are torn between complying with their doctor 
and listening to others whisper in their ear about someone who overcame 
cancer with some alternative treatment.  It's so difficult to know whom 
to 
trust, especially when burdened by testing, doctor visits, and the pain 
of knowing an abnormal growth is taking over inside one's body.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>Block new blood vessels</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Drug companies are searching for a 
common factor that is involved in all tumors.  Drugs are under testing 
that block the formation of new blood 
vessels (neovascularization, or angiogenesis) that feed the tumor 
nutrients. Patients are never told that vitamin D, bioflavonoids like 
green tea, grape 
seed extract and quercetin, are potent, natural, non-prescription 
anti-angiogenesis agents.  Breast, prostate and colon cancer rates are 
higher 
in geographic areas where there is cloud cover for many months of the 
year (northern latitudes) and natural vitamin D production via solar 
ultraviolet 
radiation skin exposure is impaired.  Many drug companies are working to
 make synthetic varieties to vitamin D to treat cancer.  Cancer patients
 can 
purchase natural vitamin D3 cheaply at health food stores.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>Gene therapy</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Another promising cancer treatment 
patients may hear about is gene therapy. To date, gene therapy has not 
produced one cure for any disease.  Some gene therapy experiments have 
produced mortal side effects.  Mutations of DNA, the genetic material in
 cells, are healed with folic acid, a B vitamin that is required for the
 formation of DNA.  In fact, one of the commonly-used cancer drugs is an
 anti-folic acid agent that causes cells to die.  The problem is that it
 also causes healthy cells to die off as well.  This is why oncologists 
say vitamins interfere with treatment.  How will the cells ever 
return to normal without folic acid?
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Mutations within the mitochondria of
 cells are another common factor in malignancies.  The mitochondria are 
small bodies within cells that surround 
the cell nucleus and produce all the cellular energy.  They are the 
cell's atomic power plants.  Coenzyme Q10 is a natural mitochondrial 
antioxidant 
that thwarts mutations in the mitochondria.  It is another natural 
cancer therapy agent.  Natural gene therapy can be performed with folic 
acid and 
coenzyme Q10.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>Blocking the spread of tumors (metastasis)</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Still, we search for a knock out 
drop, a remedy that will shrink tumors and make them disappear.  
Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy all shrink tumors, but they 
haven't increased survival rates.  The gold standard for cancer 
treatment is survival, not the size of the tumor.  Survival rates are 
fairly high as long as tumors don't spread (a process called 
metastasis). Once linked to newly-formed blood vessels, tumors release 
malignant cells 
into the blood circulation where they are challenged by tumor fighting 
cells of the immune system (natural killer cells, phagocytes, thymus 
cells and 
others).  This is why the immune system is important.  Some natural 
agents, like echinacea or medicinal mushrooms (maitake or reiki) are 
sometimes 
employed to boost immunity.  It is unlikely that a tumor cell will 
survive against the immune system.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Tumors cells must stop in one 
location for 20 minutes to begin to colonize in another location.  What 
would make tumor cells stop within the fast-moving 
circulatory system?  A blood clot.  The clot works like stickly 
fly-paper to catch tumor cells and start a new tumor-cell colony.  
Nearly all cancer 
patients exhibit a tendency towards thick blood.  This is well 
documented in the medical literature, yet not one oncologist addresses 
this issue.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">In 1979 a British researcher studied
 532 of his patients taking blood-thinning medications for 12 years.  
Seventeen of these patients 
developed tumors, but non spread to another location, they remained 
local. Cancer patients should know that vitamin E, fish oil or flaxseed 
oil, 
magnesium and garlic are all natural agents that help to thin the blood 
and prevent the spread of tumors.  A cure for the metastatic form of 
cancer was 
published in 1979, but the world missed it.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>The antidote to cancer: chelation</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Still, cancers grow, and they wreak 
their havoc in the brain, prostate, breast, lung and elsewhere.  All 
cancers exhibit a common phenomenon --- the 
massive arrival of iron and copper at the tumor site.  These metallic 
minerals are rusting agents (oxidants).  They are apparently sent to the
 
tumor site as part of the healing mechanism to kill off any undesirable 
viruses or bacteria.  Immune-fighting cells, the phagocytes, 
over-respond to 
the cellular chaos and arrive in such large numbers at the tumor site, 
they also begin to dump iron and copper.  The result is destruction of 
the 
surrounding tissues and eventually loss of function of the affected 
organ.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Another problem is that iron feeds 
tumor cells.  Iron is a growth factor for viruses, bacteria, fungi and 
tumor cells.  Take away the iron and copper and 
you stop tumor growth and shrink the tumor.  Some anti-cancer drugs are 
iron-binders, such as the mycin drugs (Adriamycin), but they also 
produce 
mortal side effects.  How can iron and copper be removed from the body? 
Chelation therapy.  Chelation refers to removal (a claw) of minerals.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">The body performs its own chelation 
by producing iron-binding molecules (ferritin, transferrin, 
lactoferrin).  These binders are often overwhelmed by 
the iron.  Transferrin transports excess iron back to the liver, which 
is where most tumors spread first.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>Glutathione</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">The body actually performs its own 
chelation on heavy metals (cadmium, lead, mercury) with glutathione.  A 
healthy liver produces a backup supply of 
glutathione when supplied sulfur.  Glutathione is nature's universal 
antioxidant.  Foods such as asparagus, garlic, onions and eggs are rich 
in 
sulfur and boost glutathione levels, as do sulfur-bearing food 
supplements such as alpha lipoic acid, N-acetyl cysteine and taurine.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>IP6 rice bran extract</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Alternative doctors perform 
chelation intravenously with a mild mineral chelator called EDTA.  But 
this approach is time-consuming and costly, and 
the tumor grows in between treatments.  The answer is to use nature's 
most powerful antioxidant and mineral chelator, phytic acid, also called
 inositol 
hexaphosphate (IP6), a component of seeds and whole grains.  IP6 is a 
6-sided molecule that works like a magnet to selectively remove iron, 
copper, 
calcium, and heavy metals, while leaving essential electrolyte minerals 
such as potassium and sodium.  When extracted from rice bran, IP6 can be
 taken orally to perform chelation therapy at home.  IP6 should be 
consumed in between meals so as not to interfere with mineral absorption
 from foods.  It should only be taken with water, as vitamin C in juices
 interferes with its action. Anemic individuals will feel weak after 
taking IP6.  (IP6 should NOT 
be taken by pregnant women, or with caution in low-dose by growing 
children who need minerals).  A decade of research with animals reveals 
that IP6 
shrinks all types of tumors (brain, lung, prostate, breast, liver, 
colon) when given to animals in their drinking water.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">A therapeutic daily dose for adults 
would be about 2400-4800 milligrams taken in one sitting.  Or a 
maintenance or preventive dose might be 1000-1600 
milligrams daily.  IP6 is the most potent anti-cancer weapon on the 
planet.  It is available at health food stores.  All IP6 is currently 
produced by 
Tsuno Foods of Wakayama, Japan, and the claim that added inositol 
improves natural killer cell function is poorly founded.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>Total regimen</b>
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">A comprehensive anti-cancer regimen of natural agents would include:
</font></p><ul>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><li>Vitamin D3, 5000+ IU</li>
<li>Folic acid 800 mcg</li>
<li>Coenzyme Q10 100-200 mg</li>
<li>Quercetin + vitamin C 2000 mg</li>
<li>Flaxseed oil 2500 mg</li>
<li>Magnesium 400 mg</li>
<li>Garlic capsules or fresh clove</li>
<li>Vitamin E 400-800 IU</li>
<li>Alpha lipoic acid 200-300 mg</li>
<li>IP6 rice bran extract in doses described above, in between meals (don't take with vitamin C at the same time)</li>
</font></ul>
<font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Other measures:<br>
Pure unchlorinated drinking water<br>
Plenty of sunlight to produce natural vitamin D<br>
