</div><p>Here it is, what you’ve all been waiting for, the interview 
with WidowsPeak. If you haven’t heard of this fella, he’s experienced <a href="http://hairregrowth.blogspot.com/">remarkable hair re-growth from primarily using beta sitosterol</a>. Without further a do…</p>
<p><strong>How do you think beta-sitoserol has helped you to regrow your hair?</strong></p>
<p>I believe that beta-sis works by blocking the binding of 5ar to 
testosterone to make DHT. This process still happens, so the body gets 
some DHT (which it needs), but not enough to kill hair follicles. This 
allows the hair to regrow.</p>
<p><strong>How long was it before you started seeing significant regrowth?</strong></p>
<p>I started to see hairs regrowing within a few weeks of taking 
beta-sis. It took about 6 months before I could see that I had hair 
regrowing about 1/2 inch below where my hairline was. Many of the hairs 
had no pigmentation, so I dyed them black and was able to capture hair 
regrowing about 1/4 inch down on film.</p>
<p>That’s how it’s been for over 2 years. I get 1/2 inch of regrowth in 
the temples, the 1/4 inch nearest the hairline shows up in photos and 
the other 1/4 inch shows up on film 6 months later.</p>
<p>So, everytime I post pics there is actually more hair regrowing than 
what you’re seeing, which is how I’m able to predict more regrowth every
 6 months. That will stop, once I get back to a straight hairline, or 
however close I can get to that. I think I’ve always had a slight widows
 peak, but time will tell.  </p>
<p><strong>Did you get any side effects (positive or negative) from taking beta-sitoserol?</strong></p>
<p>I noticed an increased libido almost immediately. I also noticed that
 when I first started taking beta-sis, my scalp got really oily. A week 
later, I noticed that my temples were starting to itch like crazy.</p>
<p>The oily scalp went away within about 3 weeks. The itching continues 
to this day, but is a lot more mild. Since the itching happens before an
 area regrows, I actually panic if I don’t feel at least a little 
itching everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think beta-sitoserol will work for everyone?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t honestly know. I think that 60% of users responding 
positively is a fair number. Propecia, which works in a similar way, but
 is much more powerful, has about an 80% success rate.</p>
<p>The thing that I will never understand is….I’ve read accounts from at
 least 3 diferent people who were using beta-sis and had hair regrowing,
 but then quit because of fears about this or that. Beta-sis is in 
fruits, vegetables and grains. Have you ever been to the doctor and had 
him tell you that you were eating too many fruits and vegetables? Of 
course not. </p>
<p><strong>What is your supplement regime (quantities / timing / brands / cycling)?</strong></p>
<p>My regimen:</p>
<p>Twinlabs Cholesterol Success, 450 mg of beta sitosterol a day for 3 weeks, then 225 mg a day for a week, every month<br>
Now Foods, Eco-Green Multi Vitamin<br>
Now Foods, Spirulina, 500 mg<br>
Now Foods, Grape Seed Standardized Extract, 100 mg<br>
Now Foods, Glucosamine Sulfate, 1,100 mg<br>
Now Foods, MSM, 1000mg<br>
Now Foods, Zinc Supplements, 50mg</p>
<p>I take my supplements on an empty stomach first thing in the morning and then exercise for an hour.</p>
<p>A big part of my regimen is the following:<br>
No shampoo<br>
No sex<br>
No junk food<br>
No meat<br>
No alcohol or drugs<br>
No caffeine</p>
<p>Please understand that you don’t need to take the same brands of 
supplements that I do. My local health food store just happens to carry 
the NOW brand.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re a carnivore, you’re probably getting enough zinc in 
your diet and over-supplementing with zinc can block your bodys’ 
absorption of copper.</p>
<p>Lastly, the spirulina is for the B12 that I don’t get from veggies and the glucosamine is for my back.<br>
 <strong><br>
What sorts of foods does your typical daily diet involve?</strong></p>
<p>I eat 3 small avacados for luch almost everyday. They are high in 
beta-sis (75mg beta-sis per 100 grams of avacado) and glutathione (an 
essential amino acid that has anti-aging properties).</p>
<p>Alot of my diet is geared towards my 18 years as a vegetarian, so I 
eat things like the grain quinoa (keen-wah) to get all my proteins, I 
eat some soy, beans, fruits, veggies, brazil nuts (another complete 
protein). Lately I’ve been eating goji berries (another complete protein
 with 18 amino acids), as they have a polysaccharide in them that 
naturally boosts the bodys’ Growth Hormone levels.</p>
<p>I try not to eat after 8pm at night, as that can cause your IGF levels to spike, making you obese.<br>
 <strong><br>
How often do you wash you hair and what with? Do you use hot, cold or warm water?</strong></p>
<p>My hair is essentially self-cleaning, so I only rinse it about once 
every 2 weeks with cold water. Cold water forces toxins out of your 
body.<br>
 <strong><br>
Do you exercise — if so what exercise for how long and how frequently?</strong></p>
<p>I ride my bike for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour at night, as it 
is my only means of transportation to and from work. I ride up and down 
some very steep hills, so I think that’s as much exercise as I really 
need, although I do kung fu a few nights a week.</p>
<p><strong>What are your sleep patterns?</strong></p>
<p>I’m up at 6:30 am and in bed by 11pm on weekdays. On the weekends, I tend to stay up later and sleep in until 11am.</p>
<p><strong>Do you do any scalp exercises?</strong></p>
<p>I tried them for 6 months and got nothing except for increased 
wrinkles in my forehead. More power to ya, if they work for you, but 
nothing regrew hair for me until I found beta-sis. </p>
<p><strong>Do you use any topicals?</strong></p>
<p>No.I have used Apple Cider Vinegar and beer to wash my hair when I first quit using shampoo, almost 2 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Any other advice or tips for wanna-be regrowth folks out there?</strong></p>
<p>Taking beta-sis regrew my hair in the temples, but I was still losing
 hair in the crown. This didn’t stop until I gave up using shampoo. Not 
using shampoo, or “going grunge” not only stopped the fallout in my 
crown, but I regrew a bunch of hair.</p>
<p><strong>Ok. Thank you very much Mr Widows Peak for you time. I’m sure this info will be of great use to many. Cheers! </strong></p>

<div id="comment_text"><p>Sounds like you need more than just the 
Beta-Sitosterol. Maybe rogaine 5% also–and non SLS shampoo. My other two
 points of question are :::::1.You said the propecia had a 80% positive 
effect. I wonder why it is still outrageously expensive after 14 years 
on the market—still needs a yearly or bi-yearly script. 2. AS far as the
 regimen goes—are you planning an audition for “Taxi Driver 2″????</p>

<div id="comment_text"><p>starting in the morning i take<br>
nutrition house: multi vitamin and minerals including some herbs such as
 saw palmetto and nettle root (these both decrease the production of 
DHT)<br>
nutrition house: whey protein shake (just cause)<br>
2 tbl spoons of 100% organic aloe vera<br>
then i eat my breakfast including veggies, cereal, oat meal, eggs, toast
 (you get the deal anything healthly) and also yop yogurt (gimmie yop me
 mama)<br>
for lunch i eat protein rich foods such as chicken or fish and cant 
forget my veggies and after for a snak or dessert fruits any type i feel
 like and salad<br>
for dinner its basically the same deal as lunch except bigger</p>
<p>now my shower routine:<br>
half hour before i shower:<br>
mix 1 tbl spoon of olive oil with one tbl spoon mayonaise both 
preferable organic, massage in scalp for about 5 minutes leave in for 
half hour then i shower<br>
1)rinse hair with organic shampoo all natural they arent hard to find<br>
2) put a whole beat egg in my hair then massage(eggs r high in protein 
and your hair is made up of it doing this in time will make your hair 
strands thick)<br>
3)as the egg is on my head i wash my body with soap<br>
4) rinse the egg out with milder water<br>
5) 4tbl spoons on apple cider vinager in a bottle of water regular hand 
held bottle i pour that in my hair slowly while massaging it(the acv 
strips all gunk build up anything on ur scalp and hair including 
silicone from bad shampoos and also gives nutrients to your scalp and 
hair it smells bad but when u rinse it out its all good)<br>
6) fully rinse my whole body and get out<br>
i towel dry very gentle to not damage my hair<br>
7) last but not least after my hair is dry i take a tbl spoon of aloe 
vera and massage in my head and leave in untill next shower( the aloe is
 rish in vitimin e for your scalp prevents dandruff and also it is an 
anti oxidant/inflamitory so it kills off bacteria you may have on your 
head that may be causeing ur balding, might i add it works good for gel 
as well)<br>
now  i shower everyday but i dont wash my hair everyday i wash 3 times a
 week monday wednsday friday not weekends, i put egg in my hair 2 times a
 week other than that everything else i follow every other day for my 
shower routine, after 3 weeks of doing this i noticed no more hair fall 
out i was losing about 70 to 80 hairs every time i massage my head  now i
 lose maybe about 10 hairs a day from what i know off and no hair falls 
out when i massage 3 months into this routine ive noticed thicker hair 
my strands are thick but no regrowth yet i am now on the 5th month and i
 notice my hair is thick even people coment on it and also hair regrowth
 on my receiding hair line not much but there are hairs ive never seen 
there before including some dark thick hairs and also tiny black thin 
hairs and tiny blond thin hairs so no doubt this is working for me and 
hopefully this works for anyone reading if you must know i am 22 years 
old in 6 months ill be 23 and im receiding to the point where i look 
like this m like the mc donalds logo i started receiding when i was 20 
so in 2 years i lost a straight hair line and alot of hair on top they 
say the younger you are the faster your body will cure and the older the
 slower so maybe i have a good chance to get it back and if you are the 
older crowd dont give up it may take longer but in the end youl have 
your hair back so just stay committed to this for the rest of your life 
never stop a routine even if u have your hair back because your most 
likely to lose it again if you dont maintain it also wearing hats is 
just a myth that youl go bald any way i hope i helped dont use those 
scams out there that claim to do the job they might work but theyre 
expensive and they dont work fully doing it natural will work 100 
percent thank you<br>
Robert!</p>

<strong><span class="comment_author">Zisco</span>&nbsp;said on November 14, 2009 </strong>

<div id="comment_text"><p>Dear all </p>
<p>This may sound unusual to you but if it worked for me it might work 
for all in this forum!  Ok I admit that I didn’t follow Robert’s routine
 of things but basically we were on similar grounds…. </p>
<p>This might sound funny but I have to try and explain this ok… here we
 go…. First of all I made regular use of minoxidil + anti bacterial 
shampoos (Dermatil etc) and this thing basically was stressing me out 
because I was never seeing miraculous regrowrth of hair as people claim.
  I used this regularly for a year until 1 fine morning I gave up on 
using it.  And didnt use it anymore.  By then I was really stressed out 
almost no hair at the top.  </p>
<p>Giving up on the whole idea of having hair on my head, I reasoned out
 that after all Vinn Diesel looks just as attractive irrespective of the
 baldness that he sports.  So I started going to the gym.  So at least I
 won’t look like some bald weak guy in the corner…..shaved hair + 
muscles means business</p>
<p>Stress had led me to a lack of sleep/ disordered diet / skipping 
meals on a regular basis / drinking alcohol / no sex and even though I 
didnt smoke, I was a passive smoker none the less.  </p>
<p>Then I started going to gym and I got a bit obsessed about getting my
 muscles stronger.   I could barely lift up 10 kgs for 30 times 
(dumbles) when I started, It was impossible!.  4 months down the line, I
 started lifting 20kg dumbles for 60 times.  This was significantly 
stronger, an impressive weight but muscles still looked quite normal and
 not as strong as they ought to look (for what they lifted)</p>
<p>People told me that basically its because of my diet and how much I 
rest.  So then I decided to change that as well by doing the following. 
 </p>
<p> – Quit alcohol completely<br>
 – No soft drinks.<br>
 – No passive smoking<br>
 – Both multi vitamins ( I have one of each every morning) (Multi Centrum Green and Purple)<br>
 – Started eating 6 – 7 small meals a day (2 hour gap and loads of water)<br>
 – I included food and serial as one of the above mentioned meals<br>
 – Started to eat nothing up to 2 hours before I sleep<br>
 – I gave myself a minimum of 8 hours sleep per day<br>
 – Led a calm life and didnt stress out for things anymore by answering  ” so what?” to many things<br>
 – Doing my exercise properly 4-6 times a week and 2 body parts per session<br>
 – Started taking a 100% Whey protein supplement 2 mins after workout. (this is NOT an advert)</p>
<p>One fine morning.  My anti bacterial shampoo had finished.  I was 
shaving my hair anyway so I quit using it and didn’t buy another one.  I
 was now just rinsing my head with pure cold water ( you can’t go wrong 
with that one!) once  a week and I used to do it to wake up in the 
morning!  I cannot believe this but its happening. After 4 months of gym
 and 3 weeks of putting myself into the above routine  I already have 1 
cm long hair over my scalp (at the top where I almost had nothing).  So 
in my case, no fancy eggs n stuff or vinegar etc on my head so not as 
Rob is doing.  HOWEVER, there are some common things in what Rob is 
doing.  I decided to look this up and see why it was happening and i 
bumped into this forum so after reading the above I decided to share 
with you.  </p>
<p>- For starters it is clear that unlike what many “scientists”  lead 
us to think out there hair DOES regrow irrespective of hair follicle 
situation.  I used all sorts of chemical treatmens out there! And these 
chemicals were just posining my system (Anti bacterial stuff … minoxidil
 etc).  I was stressing out myself so it led me to intoxicate myself 
even more with junk food / smoke and alcohol and lack of sleep (this 
meant even more poison).  Then what should have I expected from such a 
scenario?  </p>
<p>The solution is in how strict we are with ourselves at leading a 
healthy life.  The body is truly an amazing machine!  Just like it heals
 itself when it gets cut burnt etc! It regenerates itself when you 
nourish it properly just like a biological plant does! A healthy body 
yields a healthy mind … a healthy mind yields a healthy body remember 
that!  </p>
<p>After looking up this on the internet its clear that in some way i 
stimulated my GH (Growth Hormone) to regenerate properly.  This only 
happens through leading a healthy life (the NATURAL way) or by taking 
some HGH steroid (the ARTIFICAL way which I DONT suggest due to side 
effects).  Results were visible after 4 months if you do it seriously.  I
 disagree with Rob’s accound on one thing.  While i agree that hair is 
made of protein and other nutrients.  I cannot see how nutrients could 
be any useful on the outside.  Protein and nutrients are not for topical
 use (the century old gimmick), and that is why Minoxidil doesn’t work 
so well, why? Because health has to begin from the inside.  We are what 
we do, what we eat and what we sleep end of.</p>
<p>I hope that some of you out there take this approach and try 
something all natural for a change.  If it worked for me (desparate guy 
who tried out anything on the market with no visible results or very 
minimal results), it will work for anyone!</p>
<p>Chill out</p>

<div id="comment_text"><p>Nice comments Zisco, thanks.</p>
<p>And I agree; people vastly underestimate life style factors on hair loss. </p>
<p>All these things have a massive effect on the balance of your hormones, blood flow, levels of nutrients etc. </p>
<p>And all these things in turn affect your hair health.</p>
<p>Your multi-pronged approach is excellent. More people wishing to look after their hair (and health) should start here.</p>

<strong><span class="comment_author">MarqueeMoon</span>&nbsp;said on March 7, 2010 </strong>

<div id="comment_text"><p>@Zisco: great story and approach. I agree that
 holistically approaching the hair issue as an extention of overall 
physical + mental health is the optimal way to go. </p>
<p>I’m 21 yrs old and have significantly changed my lifestyle to be 
conducive to overall health, which should result in thicker growth. I’ve
 always had thin, straight, blond hair, but in recent months I’ve had 
significant thinning and fall-out which I attribute to either MPB or 
chronic telogen effluvium (caused by malnutrition, stress and recent 
depression). I have some slight recession at the temples that has 
happened rather quickly, though seeing as I’m shedding all over I have a
 strong hunch that it is a combination of MPB, stress, and not eating 
enough (My work situation is very bad, I’ve moved back in with my 
parents because I couldn’t afford rent in NYC anymore, can barely get my
 2000 calories a day, have eaten very badly and inconsistently until the
 past 2 months). After a check-up with my doctor, I had a protein 
deficiency, a vitamin D deficiency, low cholesterol, high cortisol 
levels, bad circulation, and was general underweight and malnourished. 
Hair loss was basically no surprise. I’m in my junior year in college 
and have a large, constant workload, travel fatigue from 4+ hours on 
buses/at terminals/on the subway each day. In addition, my home 
situation is often very tense (my parents are stressed out as well, 
there are constant screaming arguments and my folks are generally on my 
ass about every little thing every day, almost nonstop). Again, hair 
loss, no surprise. I also quit my rigorous 2-year weight training + 
cardio routine (5 days a week, 30 mins cardio/30 mins weights) 4 days a 
week, which used to be my main form of stress relief but now I think 
that all the hardcore exhaustion probably added more androgens + stress 
hormones, so I stopped it. And to top it all off, I went through a 
rather painful break-up somewhere in between.<br>
In addition to stress hormones, I’m pretty concerned about androgens 
being at work here. I’m sure the two are connected in more ways than I 
know about. Plus there is the whole deal of WORRYING ABOUT OUR HAIR, 
which does not really help…</p>
<p>So. Lifestyle changes I’ve made are: </p>
<p>1. Meditation each morning, 30 to 45 minutes (either a basic calming 
practice like focusing on the breath, or Zen meditation which is 
training yourself to just sit without investing your attention in 
anything in particular. It’s truly the best thing you could do for your 
mind.)</p>
<p>2. Will probably start running/biking again soon, though I am still 
not so sure if all the sweating is good for the scalp or not… With 
cardio, the circulation is phenomenal, but I’m not sure that being 
drenched with sweat over a long period of time is any good for the hair 
and scalp. However, I’ve been doing one to two running + biking workouts
 per week. Cardio has good effects on SHBG (sex hormone binding 
globulin, in moderation). I considered taking up swimming as a 
total-body workout, but the chlorine and head caps are bad news. </p>
<p>3. Various types of yoga. I do basic postures for overall 
flexibility, ** blood circulation (very important for the hair thing! 
lots of postures increasing circulation to the head). I’m experimenting 
with yogic breathing practices (I do Anulom vilom pranayam, kapalbhati 
pranayam, and the basic yogic breath).<br>
I also put focus on strength postures, as I’ve stopped lifting weights 
but like the toned, not bulky, look of a yoga body. I generally feel 
much better doing yoga than I did afters a few years of weightlifting.<br>
I will experiment with Qi Gong and Tantric yoga in the future, but for 
now, the basic yoga plus meditation have been amazing exercise and 
stress-reducing (I’m sure that yoga has a good effect on hormones, 
including cortisol and free testosterone). </p>
<p>4. Diet in accordance with Ayurveda recommendations for hair growth. Increasing my protein intake.<br>
Breakfast:<br>
Oatmeal or cold cereal with milk/soymilk + raisins, nuts, etc.<br>
Sometimes a cup of hot milk with spices and a little butter (ayurvedic recipe)<br>
2-3 egg whites (whole eggs once a week)<br>
or toast with peanut butter<br>
Sweet, ripe fruits (Apple, pear, pomegranate, grapes, etc…)<br>
Sunflower seeds + pumpkin seeds, sometimes almonds or cashews</p>
<p>Lunch/Linner: Usually the biggest meal.<br>
Protein drink<br>
Fish/soy/veggie protein/poultry (I avoid red meat and try not to eat factory-farmed meats)<br>
Raw veggies (One or more of: Broccoli, green pepper, avocado, kale, zucchini, cucumbers, carrots…)<br>
Grain (White/brown rice/barley/buckwheat/etc.)<br>
Herb tea (mint/nettle leaf/calming herbs)</p>
<p>Dinner: Similar to lunch<br>
Raw/cooked veggies (usually greens plus another avocado)<br>
Fish/soy/veggie protein/protein drink (I try to avoid meat for dinner, usually can’t when I’m at home)<br>
Grains<br>
Sometimes a thick vegetable soup, if I have time to cook.<br>
Herb tea (mint/nettle leaf/calming herbs)</p>
<p>5. Supplements: Usually taken in the morning with or before breakfast.<br>
Saw palmetto (320 mg daily)<br>
Multivitamin (general wellbeing)<br>
Vitamin D3 (1000 – 2000 IU daily, plus sunlight exposure)<br>
Zinc (40-60 mg per daily)<br>
* Biotin (still experimenting — 2.5 to 3.5 mg daily [2500 to 3500 micrograms(mcg)])<br>
Cod liver oil (1 tbsp daily, might increase dosage)</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>1. I used Beta-sitosterol for a little while this past summer, and 
definitely got the itching + oily effects, though I stopped using it 
after about 2 months because I figured I’m not really having serious, 
noticeable hair loss, just some all-over thinning.<br>
But I’m convinced to try it again more consistently.<br>
What dosage do you guys recommend?<br>
Is any brand in particular more or less potent?</p>
<p>2. I’m sure some of you have heard of the rather iffy practice of 
Balayam (fingernail rubbing which stimulates nerves in the fingers 
apparently connected to the scalp, to regrow hair; comes from Yoga but 
is also found in reflexology). Just wondering, does anyone here practice
 it? I’ve been doing it for a few weeks and have been consistently 
getting some scalp tingling and slightly increased blood flow whenever I
 do it, thought I think it may be placebo effect. I try to do it for 
10-15 minutes, two or three times a day usually while at a lecture or on
 the bus. Will continue for a few months (it’s become almost an 
unconscious habit already), to see what happens. I’m much less skeptical
 about yoga/reflexology/acupressure/Chinese traditional 
medicine/meditation, and other such things, lately. I’ve benefited too 
much from various practices to dismiss them or be overly skeptical… </p>
<p>So, if anyone has some suggestions to the various scattered questions
 in here, and any other lifestyle/supplement/dietary sugestions, that 
would be very much appreciated.<br>
Thanks, and good luck to everyone!</p>

<div id="comment_text"><p>I just wanted to let people know that this 
actually does work. I tried all sorts of stuff including $90/mo 
“treatment” and the best anything did was slow down the loss.</p>
<p>UNTIL I stopped washing my hair and started taking beta-sis and saw 
palmetto!  I am seeing massive regrowth after only about 2 months of 
this. </p>
<p>I’m not selling anything except for hope here, just try it, what do 
you have to lose?  The money you save on shampoo will more than make up 
for the $0.25 a day or so these common supplements will cost you. </p>
<p>Just a happy camper hoping to see more people freed from this affliction.</p>

<div id="comment_text"><p>I noticed the “no sex” thing. I believe there 
is something to that. I’m not a doctor so I won’t go into it too much 
but it probably has something to do with the body’s production of 
testosterone every time you ejaculate. If I ejaculate too much over a 
course of a week, I notice considerable hair loss. When I want to 
“recover” I just stay drug-free and stay free of ejaculating for a week.
 That has been my life for the last 10 years. Losing my hair and then 
practicing discipline to grow it back. </p>
<p>I should mention that I use propecia, rogaine and saw palmetto 
religiously. And I’m convinced if I quit drugs, alcohol and limited my 
ejaculations, I would have a beautiful head of hair – not that it looks 
bad now. But like I said…I must go into “recover” periods after I have 
indulged.</p>
