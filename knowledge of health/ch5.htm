&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a name="Kervran"></a>Kervran's Proof of Biological Transmutation</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>In orthodox chemistry, one of the strongest dogmas is the stubborn insistence that it is impossible to create another element by chemical reaction.&nbsp;
Most chemists also insist that all reactions occurring in living systems are chemical in nature.&nbsp;
They believe fervently that chemistry can and must explain life itself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1960's, a French researcher named Louis Kervran published work which flew directly in the face of the accepted chemistry dogma.&nbsp;
Kervran reported the astounding results of his research showing that living plants were able to accomplish limited transmutation of elements.&nbsp;
Kervran was then the Conferences Director at the University of Paris, and his first paper was published in
<b> La Revue Generale Des Sciences</b>, July 1960.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was so revolutionary was that, according to the prevailing wisdom of science, you can't transmute elements (permanently change the nucleus) except with enormous energy
- certainly not with the microvolts and millivolts (and microwatts and milliwatts) that living systems can muster electromagnetically.*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rutherford, the British physicist who discovered the nucleus of the atom, had shown in 1919 that you can bombard elements with alpha particles and transmute them.&nbsp;
The accepted wisdom of today is exactly the same, except that the physicists have used heavier and heavier &quot;bullets&quot; in their artillery approach.&nbsp;
No one has tried a controlled approach, for the catechism is that you have to use the <i>wham it harder! </i>approach.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, to most scientists the whole thing had to be preposterous, and Kervran had to be deluded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kervran published further details of his work in a book,
<b>Transmutations Biologiques</b>, Maloine, Paris 1962. But the initial reaction
of most scientists was</font>

*Note, however, that since gravity is infolded EM, one can have extremely powerful infolded EM, yet only have miniscule electrical (outfolded) residues.&nbsp;
Thus the actual &quot;available power&quot; in artificial biopotentials may not be quite so small after all.</font>
        <hr>
  </center>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">was disbelief and
        skepticism.&nbsp; Few scientists would stoop to repeating Kervran's
        experiments, which of course they knew could not work anyway.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually the effect is widespread amongst
        living systems.&nbsp; As Kervran pointed out, the ground in Brittany contained
        no calcium; however, every day a hen would lay a perfectly normal egg,
        with a perfectly normal shell containing calcium.&nbsp; The hens do eagerly
        peck mica from the soil, and mica contains potassium - a single step
        below calcium in the standard table of elements.&nbsp; It appears that the
        hens may transmute some of the potassium to calcium.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if one tests this assumption, it
        is quickly shown to be true.&nbsp; Hens denied calcium but not potassium, stay
        perfectly healthy and lay perfectly normal eggs.&nbsp; Hens denied both
        potassium and calcium will be sickly and lay only soft-shelled eggs.&nbsp;
        If
        these sick chickens are allowed to peck only mica - which they will
        frantically do - everything returns to normal again.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most orthodox scientists nevertheless
        remained skeptical or downright hostile.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a few other scientists began to
        repeat Kervran's experiments and</font><p align="left"><img border="0" src="f72.jpg" width="525" height="324"><br>

      effect.&nbsp; A biosystem can accomplish limited transmutation of<br>
      elements</font>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">replicate his results. Several of these
        corroborating scientists were (1) Professor Hisatoki Komaki, Chief of
        the Laboratory of Applied Microbiology at a leading Japanese university,
        (2) Professor Pierre Baranger, Head of the Laboratory of Chemi-<br>
        cal Biology of the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and (3) J.E. Zundel,
        then head of a paper company with a chemical analysis laboratory, and
        later a chemical engineer of the Polytechicum School of Zurich,
        Switzerland.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later work by Zundel was particularly
        decisive: he utilized the mass spectrometer at the Microanalysis
        Laboratory of the French National Scientific Research Center, and
        neutron activation mass analysis at the Swiss Institute for Nuclear
        Research in Villigen to positively confirm an increase in calcium of 61%
        to an accuracy of 2%.&nbsp; Such results and instrumentation, of course,
        removed any doubt that the effect could be due to statistical
        variation.&nbsp; In the same experiments, the plants increased their
        phosphorus 29% and their sulphur 36%.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Komaki became head of a research
        laboratory at Matsushita Electric Company. There he conducted research
        conclusively proving that microorganisms (including some bacteria and
        two kinds each of molds and yeast) could transmute sodium into
        potassium.&nbsp; In fact, he placed a brewer's yeast product on the
        market that, when applied to composts, increases their potassium
        content.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive work in the area has been done
        in the Soviet Union, where results similar to Kervran's have been
        substantiated.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus all doubt (to an open-minded
        scientist) was removed:&nbsp; living systems are able to change one
        element into another by some unknown means, using very feeble energy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noted French physicist, O Costa De
        Beauregard, suggested a mechanism for the transmutations, using weak
        force interactions and advanced waves.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one - even Kervran himself - thought of
        negative energy/ negative time interactions.&nbsp; The jury is still out
        on the actual mechanism, but it is absolutely clear that the
        transmutation does indeed occur .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese researchers, having
        replicated Kervran's astounding results to their complete satisfaction,
        recommended him to the Nobel Committee for a Nobel Prize for such
        epochal work.&nbsp; Thus Kervran became a Nobel nominee, though he was
        not granted the prize.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kervran has since passed away, leaving
        behind his books and papers that point to a revolution in chemistry and
        physics - transmutation of elements at very weak energy.</font>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b><a name="Biological Transmutation Has a History">Biological
        Transmutation Has a History</a><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i>Actually biological transmutation
        - and transmutation of elements (alchemy) in general - has a history, of
        both results and suppression.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, a celebrated
        French chemist, discovered that chickens could produce more calcium in
        their eggshells than entered their bodies.&nbsp; Hence they had to be
        able to &quot;create&quot; the calcium, else their own bodies would have
        been completely depleted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of his contemporaries, however -
        Antoine Laurent Lavoisier - became the &quot;father of chemistry
        .&quot;&nbsp; Lavoisier laid down the dictum that nothing was
        created.&nbsp; So chemistry fixed upon the notion that the combinations
        of elements could be shifted, but the element itself could not be
        transformed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not until the discovery of radioactivity
        did any crack in this solid wall appear.&nbsp; But still, the basic
        ideas of chemistry said the element couldn't be transformed
        chemically.&nbsp; It could only be transformed if one blasted the
        daylights out of it with an atomic or particle bullet.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today most chemists still hold that exact
        same opinion, unshaken.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To resume: Over a century ago, a chemist
        named Albrecht von Herzeele proved that germinating seeds somehow
        transmuted elements in the process.&nbsp; In 1873 von Herzeele
        published a book, <b>The Origin of Inorganic Substances, </b>where he
        showed research proving that plants continuously create material
        elements.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even earlier, in 1822 an Englishman named
        William Prout had studied chicken eggs in incubation.&nbsp; He found
        that hatched chicks had more lime (calcium) in their bodies than was
        originally present in the egg!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another French scientist named Henri
        Spindler discovered that a kind of algae called Laminaria could create
        iodine.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A German researcher named Vogel had
        planted cress seeds in a bell jar.&nbsp; They were fed nothing but
        distilled water; still, when grown they contained more sulphur than had
        been in the seeds originally.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawes and Gilbert, two British
        researchers, also found that plants could &quot;extract&quot; more
        elements from the soil than the soil actually contained in the first
        place.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baranger performed thousands of meticulous
        experiments in plant transmutation of elements.&nbsp; He proved that the
        transmutations do occur.&nbsp; He also discovered that many things
        affected the germinating seed transmutation process: the time the seeds
        germi-<br>
        nate, the type of light they are exposed to, the phase of the moon, etc.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these experimenters understood the
        transmutation process used by the living organism.&nbsp; But they proved
        beyond question that the process existed, and universally occurred.</font>

        Mechanisms Proposed by the U.S. Army&nbsp;</a></b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>There has also been other very positive
        support for the thesis that if living systems transmute elements, they
        can produce a net source of energy in the process.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1978 an officially-funded effort of the
        U .S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command, Fort
        Belvoir, Virginia positively confirmed that mechanisms for elemental
        transmutations could occur in biological systems, from an energy
        consideration.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work was performed under the direction
        of Emil J. York, Chief of the Material Technology Laboratory.&nbsp;
        Solomon Goldfein was the principal investigator for the effort. Robert
        C. McMillan, Chief of the Radiation Research Group of the laboratory,
        provided guidance on matters of physics and nuclear physics.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abstract of the final report (S.
        Goldfein, Report 2247, <b>Energy Development from Elemental
        Transmutations in Biological Systems</b>, U .S. Army Mobility Equipment
        Research and Development Command, May 1978. DDC No. AD AO56906.) reads
        as follows:</font>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;The
        purpose of the study was to determine whether recent disclosures of
        elemental transmutations occurring in biological entities have revealed
        new possible sources of energy.&nbsp; The works of Kervran, Komaki, and
        others were surveyed, and it was concluded that, granted the existence
        of such transmutations (Na to Mg, K to Ca, and Mn to Fe), then a net
        surplus of energy was also produced.&nbsp; A proposed mechanism was
        described in which Mg adenosine triphosphate, located in the
        mitochondrion of the cell, played a double role as an energy
        producer.&nbsp; In addition to the widely accepted biochemical role of
        MgATP in which it produces energy as it disintegrates part by part,
        MgATP can also be considered to be a cyclotron on a molecular
        scale.&nbsp; The MgATP when placed in layers one atop the other has all
        the attributes of a cyclotron in accordance with the requirements set
        forth by E.O. Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. &quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was concluded that elemental
        transmutations were indeed occurring in life organisms and were probably
        accompanied by a net energy gain.&quot;</i></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        researchers also concluded that elemental transmutations occurring in
        life organisms are accompanied by losses in mass representing conversion
        to thermal energy, and that such energy probably is a net gain when
        compared to the amount required to effect the transmutation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, they concluded that the little
        cell with its feeble energy does quite well!&nbsp; It's in control of
        cyclotrons, and cyclotron forces, and direct conversion of mass to
        energy.&nbsp; Pretty good for a little bitty beastie, wouldn't you say?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, one should point out that,
        according to nuclear physics, an atom gets a little heavier when it
        absorbs {usually by means of an orbital electron) a normal
        &quot;positive energy&quot; photon.&nbsp; That is, the addition of
        positive energy results in the addition of a little bit of
        &quot;positive mass.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative energy, of course, does a similar
        thing to the nucleus - except that it adds &quot;negative
        mass.&quot;&nbsp; Thus the nucleus of the atom, when it absorbs negative
        energy, gets lighter.&nbsp; This is seen in the external world as
        &quot;loss of mass.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our present nuclear physics, only
        positive energy is assumed except in extremely rare cases.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Army study - which was conducted
        and controlled by some excellent scientists - worked out a &quot;loss of
        mass&quot; the way they're trained to.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By adding some positive energy, the
        nucleus would gain some positive mass.&nbsp; By adding some negative
        energy, the nucleus would lose some corresponding positive mass.&nbsp;
        The conventional physics then would equate this &quot;loss of mass&quot;
        as the direct conversion of mass to energy.&nbsp; And so it is, only
        it's conversion to negative energy!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, by pointing out the cyclotron
        mechanism in the cell MgATP, the Army researchers have made a most
        important contribution.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note also that the whirling motion may be
        very much related to Viktor Schauberger's work and to Wilhelm Reich's
        work.&nbsp; Both of them worked with what they viewed as an unusual kind
        of living, spiraling energy .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the orbital electrons of an atom also
        are whirling around in orbit, in the simplest model.&nbsp; Further,
        these orbits themselves move and rotate or precess.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar orbits and shells occur in the
        nucleus, at least in some models (several rather independent models are
        used there for specific things.)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that a whirling, spiraling
        (cyclotron) energy motion is necessary to connect positive energy to
        orbital electron (negative charge) shells, and to connect negative
        energy to positive charge shells in the atomic nucleus.*</font>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>In ancient times, the old alchemists
        pursued the dream of making gold.&nbsp; Obviously, if one could do that
        economically, one could become quite wealthy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as obviously, the kings and rulers of
        the world took rather a dim view of such proceedings.&nbsp; After all,
        much of their own power rested on their ability to get and control
        gold.&nbsp; And if some &quot;loose cannon&quot; could make all the gold
        anyone wanted, then the national treasury of the king wouldn't be worth

      are some unorthodox researchers today who take the view that the

      Moray</a> had a process to &quot;recover finely divided gold from
      quartzite sands.&quot;&nbsp; My personal, strong belief is that he possessed a
      practical transmutation process.&nbsp; His knowledge and techniques, of
      course, are still possessed by his sons, and reside through them in Cosray
      Research Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possession of such a technical
      secret may be one of the major reasons why the Morays have met with such
      intrigue, harassment, and suppression over the years.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak further on &quot;making gold,&quot;
      we first have to present some details on some special &quot;critters&quot;
      that live, but that can't be observed through a normal microscope - even
      an electron microscope.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that vein, toward the end of this
      chapter, we will present some of Royal R. Rife's fundamental discoveries.&nbsp;
      Pay particular attention to his discovery of &quot;finer&quot; living
      forms - which today we could only refer to as &quot;living energy,
      virtual-state forms.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's call them <b>critters </b>for short.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, when the earth was young and
      the radiation from the sun was different, conditions on earth were much
      hotter.&nbsp; Great volcanic activity and fiery eruptions were commonplace
      and nearly continuous.&nbsp; Huge storms, of size and magnitude undreamed
      of today, swept the primitive atmosphere.&nbsp; The oceans were frenzied. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under those conditions, many types of
      &quot;critters&quot; were highly active.&nbsp; Most of the critters, for
      example, lived in and worked on the atomic nuclei of matter.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the critters are living,
      virtual-state organisms.&nbsp; There's a continual exchange between the
      virtual state (the vacuum, or spacetime) and mass (the observable state).
      An atomic nucleus is like an island in the &quot;virtual state
      ocean&quot;, and the flux interchange is like waves breaking onto the
      island and then washing back to sea.&nbsp; The critters live in that
      ocean, and wash upon, so-to-speak, the mass-islands and interact with
      them.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those primal days, many of the present
      great mineral deposits of the earth were created due to the transmutation
      activities of the critters.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One kind, for example, lived in copper.&nbsp;
      In an &quot;energetics&quot; sense, this critter &quot;ate&quot; copper
      and &quot;excreted&quot; gold, so-to-speak.&nbsp; Much of the gold that
      occurs in great copper deposits today was formed this way in the old days
      under primal conditions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When conditions on earth changed, these
      little &quot;copper critters&quot; ceased their incessant activity and
      became dormant, just as viruses can do.&nbsp; But the critters are still
      there in the copper ore, waiting to be activated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arid activate them you can!&nbsp; You can
      even get the critters into a solution, and then crystallize them out as
      crystals.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These crystals are what the alchemists of
      old called the <b>philosopher's </b>stone, with the power to transmute
      base elements into gold.&nbsp; There are several kinds of philosopher's
      stones; this kind is for copper.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, you can then place these
      special crystals on some copper (and add another thing or two), and
      restore them to a similar primal environment as of old.&nbsp; That is,
      heat them in an electric furnace.&nbsp; Blast them with terrible
      electrical bolts.&nbsp; Bathe them in intense ultraviolet light.&nbsp;
      That's just a nice, refreshing spring day for the critters!*<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stimulates them and revives them.&nbsp;
      They wake up after a long sleep - and they're immediately &quot;hungry
      .&quot;&nbsp; So they go right to work on the copper.&nbsp; Boom!&nbsp; In
      a little bit there isn't any more copper, just mostly gold, with a little
      other miscellaneous residue thrown in, such as black ruby and silver (in
      the experiments of one of my close colleagues).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold is radioactive when first made.&nbsp;
      Fortunately, all isotopes of gold are very short-lived:&nbsp; just minutes
      suffice for the radioactivity to die away.&nbsp; So you wait half an hour
      and everything's okay.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's all there is to it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arid if you do that and try to capitalize
      upon it, your life expectancy is about 24 hours.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Obviously, to transmute elements the living system has to be able to directly affect and influence the atomic nucleus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been shown that this is a cellular capability, for single-celled organisms can do it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we shall see, Rife's work showed that the living cell is connected to at least 16 internested deeper levels of reality than a relative &quot;point&quot; under an ordinary microscope. Further, all levels are structured and organized.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it!&nbsp; Each one of those levels is to the preceding level as microscopy today is to the normal world.&nbsp;
Sixteen levels!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's reasonable to state that the life of the cell is patterned and dynamically structured and functioning all the way into the virtual state; indeed, to very deep internested levels of the virtual state.&nbsp;
That is, it also functions <i>hyperspatially.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>We shall also see that the mind and thought involve these more subtle physical (though virtual) levels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the living virtual-state levels are a reality, for Rife proved it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living organized structures at each level are a reality, for Rife proved it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living ordering and control of dynamic functions on all those levels is a reality, for Rife proved it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those living virtual-level parts of the living organism
- plant or animal - thus affect, function in, and reside in the atomic nuclei of the material that composes its bodily structures.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beasties like bacteria and viruses also have living, organized energy structures in multiple levels of virtual state.&nbsp;
Apparently, for these more primitive life forms, the virtual-state &quot;energy part&quot; can be separated and pass through a filter, then re-engender the
physical form and/or itself cause the disease in a host!&nbsp; At least that is what Rife and other scientists showed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;Bigger fleas have smaller fleas to bite 'em, And so on, ad infinitum. </i>&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the living system can &quot;work on&quot; the nucleus
and change it a little bit!&nbsp; If it couldn't do so, it couldn't stay alive
and function in there in the first place!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Dr. Vlail Kaznacheyev is Director of the
Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Novosibirsk.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 20 years he has been directing highly unusual
experiments with twin cell cultures. These experiments are vital to
understanding disease and healing on a more fundamental basis than is presently
utilized by orthodox medical science.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kaznacheyev experiments (several thousand) in
the Soviet Union proved conclusively that any cellular disease or death pattern
can be transmitted electromagnetically, and induced in target cells absorbing
the radiation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experiments, two sealed containers were
placed side by side, with a thin optical window separating them. The two
containers were completely environmentally shielded except for the optical
coupling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tissue was separated into two identical samples,
and one sample placed in each of the two halves of the apparatus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cells in one sample (on one side of the glass)
were then subjected to a deleterious agent - a selected virus, bacterial
infection, chemical poison, nuclear radiation, deadly ultraviolet radiation,
etc.&nbsp; This led to disease and death of the exposed/infected cell culture
sample.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the thin optical window was made of ordinary
window glass, the uninfected cells on the other side of the window were
undamaged and remained healthy.&nbsp; This of course was as expected in the
orthodox medical view.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the thin optical window was made of
quartz, a most unexpected thing happened.&nbsp; Some time (usually about 12
hours) after the disease appeared in the infected sample, the same features of
disease appeared in the uninfected sample.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This startling &quot;infection by optical coupling&quot;
occurred in a substantial percentage of the tests (70 to 80 percent).&nbsp; From
an orthodox medical view, these results were unexpected and unheard of.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if the originally uninfected cells were
in optical contact with the infected&nbsp;</font>

      <p align="left">

<img border="0" src="f75.jpg"><p align="left"><font size="3">cells for 18-20
      hours or so, and then were correspondingly exposed (optically coupled) to
      another uninfected cell sample, symptoms of the infection appeared in this
      third sample an appreciable portion of the time (20 to 30 percent).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guided by A.G. Gurvitsch's work that showed
      that cells give off mitogenetic radiation (photons) that can affect other
      cells, the Kaznacheyev team sought an answer by looking for photons given
      off by the infected culture sample as its cells died.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found that the cells in the infected
      culture gave off photons in the near ultraviolet when they died.&nbsp; The
      normal window glass was opaque to these near-UV photons and absorbed
      them.&nbsp; In that case, the uninfected culture on the other side of the
      glass was not exposed to radiation by the UV &quot;death&quot; photons
      from the dying cells, and they remained serenely healthy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the quartz window was transparent
      to the UV &quot;death photons&quot;.&nbsp; When the quartz window was
      installed, the UV &quot;death photons&quot; passed through it and were
      absorbed in the uninfected culture on the other side of the window.&nbsp;
      Most of the time, the uninfected culture which absorbed &quot;death
      photons&quot; sickened and died with the same disease symptoms.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kaznacheyev experiments proved
      conclusively that cellular death and disease patterns can be transmitted
      and induced electromagnetically.*</font>

      and Charging a Biopotential</a><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i>Kaznacheyev
      thus demonstrated that a photon information/ regulatory system exists in
      biological systems due to a continual influx of EM energy from outside the
      system.&nbsp; That is, the cells of the biosystem are charged with an
      electromagnetic potential, and additions and changes to the potential are
      continually received.&nbsp; The cell is thus in minute disequilibrium.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually the
      myriad of continual inputs from the external environment into the cell's
      potential charge pattern (in its atomic nuclei) may be taken to be
      potential changes whose substructures are <i>disordered.&nbsp; </i>In that
      case, no specific environmental effect is observed except slight
      fluctuations without order - a miniscule form of &quot;heating.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a
      continual <i>ordered </i>substructure exists in the input from the
      external environment into the cell's potential, the cell's potential will
      gradually &quot;charge up&quot; with that pattern.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analogy
      will prove helpful.&nbsp; Imagine an accumulator, a large pot, that holds
      a volume of water.&nbsp; Several pipes are connected to the pot, some are
      inputs for water coming in, and some are outputs for water flowing in.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine
      the inputs all containing &quot;blue&quot; water, just in slightly varying
      shades.&nbsp; The water in the pot is blue, and may slightly rise and fall
      in level as the input flow rates vary. The water in the pot may also vary
      slightly in its blueness as the inputs vary.&nbsp; However, it will still
      be blue.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
      suppose that yellow water starts flowing through one of the input pipes,
      and at a goodly rate.&nbsp; Slowly the water in the pot will start to turn
      greenish as a greater percentage of yellow builds up.&nbsp; In other
      words, the pot slowly charges up with some of the &quot;yellow&quot;
      charge, in the process acquiring a &quot;green&quot; charge.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biopotential in the cell
      experiments works the same way.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cell has a biopotential built up,
      which represents the &quot;nominal equilibrium&quot; of the scalar charge
      on the cell.&nbsp; This biopotential, being mostly a &quot;sum-zero&quot;
      of virtual state vectors, is centered in and on the atomic nuclei of the
      cell, constituting charge patterns in these atomic nuclei.&nbsp; The
      biopotential extends out of the atomic nuclei, through the electron
      shells, into and through the molecules, through the internal cell
      structures and membrane, and outside the cell.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the atomic nucleus on out through
      the cell, every layered structure or organization of the cell will layer,
      structure, and.organize the biopotential accordingly.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organized, structured cellular
      biopotential is continually receiving &quot;charge patterns&quot;
      contained in incoming photons absorbed by the cell.&nbsp; The biopotential
      is also continually exhausting some of its biopotential charge pattern in
      the photons (heat, light, etc.) that the cell emits.</font><p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b><a name="The Cell's Electromagnetic Breathing">The
      Cell's Electromagnetic Breathing</a></b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Via structured photon exchange,
      the biopotential of the living cell thus &quot;breathes in&quot; the
      virtual state charge structure of its environment, and &quot;breathes
      out&quot; its own internal virtual state charge structure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the experiment, the uninfected
      cells are continually absorbing photons from their surrounding
      environment, and emitting photons back to it as well.&nbsp; According to
      our scalar EM view, each photon it absorbs has a substructure that depends
      upon the part of the environment from whence it came.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These &quot;substructures&quot; are
      actually patterns of the sum-zeroed virtual vectors comprising the
      potential of the absorbed photon carriers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, since a large number of very
      different substructures are continually being &quot;input&quot; into the
      cell's potential from the absorbed photons, the substructure of the cell's
      potential receives an essentially disorganized continual input from the
      environment.&nbsp; This equates to the fact that the environment does not
      normally specifically influence or change the cell's potential with
      ordered information (organization).*</font>

      <hr>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">*There may be sufficient ordered input from
      the environment, however, to have something to do with territoriality in

      <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a cell
      dies, it ceases to maintain the bio-dynamics that sustained its artificial
      potential (that part due to bio-ordering by its organized life processes,
      above the background level of its &quot;inert matter&quot;
      potential).&nbsp; The dead cell's built-up artificial potential then
      &quot;discharges&quot; by emitting a structured photon.**<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this photon (energy) comes from an <i><b>organized
      potential drop, the virtual substructure of the emitted photon is
      organized.</b>&nbsp; </i><b>The photon, then - among other things -

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly insist on the quantum mechanical
      view here:&nbsp; All physical changes - chemical, material, mechanical,
      whatever -at root level are constituted and caused by virtual state
      interactions, in direct patterns of virtual particle exchanges.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the full QM view, what's really going on

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>At any rate, the Kaznacheyev experiments
      showed that the dying cells from the infected culture emitted photons in
      the near UV that contained artificial (structured) potentials.&nbsp; The
      virtual-state, patterned-substructures in this photon flux directly
      represented the cellular disease pattern caused by the original cell's
      specific infection.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as the infected cells died,
      they emitted &quot;death photons&quot; which contained the template
      pattern of their death condition.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these &quot;death photons&quot; are
      absorbed into uninfected cells, their deterministic substructures

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master cellular control system of the
          biosystem is itself a dynamically changing, ordered pattern in the
          biopotential of the cells, which is centered in the atomic nuclei
          comprising the cell materials.&nbsp; As the bio-potentials of the cells
          gradually acquire the &quot;death photon's&quot; substructure pattern,
          this pattern is also diffused throughout (modulates) the master
          cellular control system.&nbsp; All the cells in the sample (or in a
          biosystem) are now slowly charging up with the &quot;death
          photon&quot; pattern.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Popp discovered, photons continually
          &quot;leak out&quot; of the virtual photon master control system of
          the biosystem.&nbsp; Some of these <i>leakage photons </i>are observable
          photons, <b> but most are virtual photons.</b><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, they are <i>structured </i>photons.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as leakage photons spill
          out of the master control system, observable change is now being
          slowly initiated in the physical structures, biochemistry, etc. of
          the biosystem's cells - and these changes are in consonance with the
          integrated &quot;cellular death pattern&quot; of the originally
          infected cells.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note particularly that it is already
          well-known in quantum mechanics/electrodynamics that, when a photon
          is emitted from the surface of a dielectric body, the entire
          dielectric body participates in that emission.&nbsp; If a photon is absorbed
          on the surface of the dielectric body, the entire</b></font>
        <b> </b><font size="3"><b>dielectric body participates in that
        absorption.</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus as irradiation by the &quot;death
        photons&quot; continues, the &quot;death structure&quot; in the
        irradiated cells increases.&nbsp; It is spread throughout the cell
        culture by the master communication system, gradually charging the
        virtual state structure of that system with the death pattern.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spillage photons from the cellular control
        system occur throughout the culture.&nbsp; These photons are structured
        with the death pattern, and gradually affect the cell and its
        biochemistry physically.&nbsp; The previously uninfected cells thus
        physically start to acquire and exhibit the symptoms and characteristics
        of the disease pattern that killed the infected cells.

        in Physical Disease</a></b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The new cells are now
        electromagnetically infected and physically diseased.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, that is all a cellular disease
        is in the first place - physical, electrical, and biochemical changes in
        the normal functioning of the cell.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a given pattern of changes in the
        cells, a specific &quot;disease&quot; exists in them.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It absolutely does not matter what causes
        this exact pattern.&nbsp; If the specific physical pattern is there, the
        specific disease is there.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that any ghost pattern in the virtual
        state flux can charge up physical matter - that is, the atomic nuclei of
        a mass.&nbsp; All that is necessary is that a continual flux of this
        virtual pattern continually bathe (irradiate) the mass's atomic nuclei.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eventual emergence of this &quot;ghost
        template pattern&quot; into observable physical reality is called
        kindling.&nbsp; Kindling is charging up one or more atomic nuclei with
        an integrated virtual charge pattern until the integrated pattern
        breaches the quantum threshold, resulting in emergence of that pattern
        into observable physical change.</p>

        Dr. William C. Douglass for pointing this out to me, and for permission

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's amazing what you can find by
        nosing around in the dusty archives of a good medical library.&nbsp; I came
        across another remarkable therapy that the AMA and drug industry (or
        whoever is in charge of suppressing non-toxic treatments that work) have
        shoved down the memory hole.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back in 1933, Doctors Hancock and
        Knott treated a patient dying of septicemia (blood poisoning) with
        ultraviolet irradiation of the blood.</font><font size="2"><sup>l</sup></font><font size="3">&nbsp;
        The patient was moribund with a blood stream infection and obviously
        near death. (Remember that this was before antibiotics and there was
        nothing to lose.)&nbsp; The patient made a complete and uneventful recovery
        .&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Searching further, I found that in
        1928 a similar terminal infection was treated by ultraviolet light to
        the blood.&nbsp; This patient also made a complete recovery.</font><font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><font size="3"> &quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So in 1928, practically in the
        middle ages, an incurable disease, blood stream infection, was cured
        with ultraviolet light.&nbsp; With such a breakthrough why wasn't it tried
        again for 5 <i>years?&nbsp; </i>According to the record, <i>another </i>6 <i>years
        </i>passed before it was tried for a third time.</font><font size="2"><sup>3</sup></font><font size="3">&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back in those days infection was the
        number one cause of death.&nbsp; You can't help but wonder how many lives
        could have been saved if doctors weren't so resistant to new ideas.&nbsp;
        Just
        imagine a cure for AIDS being set aside for 11 years.&nbsp; Yet bacterial
        infections of the blood were uniformly fatal in 1935, just like AIDS is

      Factors Influencing It</a></b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The cellular disease induction effect
      was called the mirror cytopathogenic effect (CPE for short) by the
      Kaznacheyev group.&nbsp; Mirror CPE appeared only when the quartz or mica window
      was no thicker than 0.8 mm.&nbsp; A. F. Kirkin also duplicated the experiments
      using a thin plexiglas window.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are conditions which enhance the
      effect, and others which inhibit or degrade it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Irradiation of the
      detector-culture with a low dose of UV prior to its optical contact
      enhances the effect, increasing</font> <font size="3">
      it to certainty (99-100% ).&nbsp; Increasing the temperature to 38.5
      degrees centigrade also enhances the effect (from 37% to 90% for
      example).*</font>
  <hr>
      

      <p align="left"><font size="2">*This is very important.&nbsp;
      Preconditioning the cells by &quot;dithering&quot; them in the frequency
      band of interest, or in a subharmonic band, &quot;livens&quot; the cells
      for developing the irradiated pattern.&nbsp; This is similar to a dither
      voltage placed on a missile fin, making it much easier and quicker for the
      fin to move when an actual order is placed on it.</font>
  <hr>
      

      <p align="left"><font size="3">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A necessary condition for the success of the
      experiment is the rotation of the holder with its two optically-coupled
      samples at a rate of about 24-25 revolutions per hour.&nbsp; Optical
      contact between the inductor and detector cells for a minimum of 4-6 hours
      is necessary, after which the cell cultures can be separated.&nbsp; A
      longer contact time is necessary for complete development of the
      irreversible effect.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both cultures must be maintained in complete
      darkness throughout the experiment.&nbsp; Use of the detector as a new
      inductor in a successive state reduces the effect by 20-30%.&nbsp; Three
      or four such stages is sufficient to eliminate the effect.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a seasonal variation in the
      results.&nbsp; In more than 15,000 experiments, monthly variations and
      daily variations were noted.&nbsp; (The present author's interpretation of
      this is that it is due to the monthly variations in the virtual photon
      substructure input from the moon to the substructure of the cell's
      bio-potential.&nbsp; The daily variation is due to the daily variations in
      the virtual photon substructure input from the sun to the substructure of
      the cell's bio-potential.)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative results appear more often in
      winter.&nbsp; (The present author's interpretation of this is that it is
      due to the fact that the scalar potentials of the earth and the
      biopotentials of each living cell on earth are lowered in winter by the
      weaker flux from the sun.)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects are correlated with the polarity of
      the interplanetary magnetic field.&nbsp; Negative polarity of the field
      usually precedes the appearance of mirror CPE.&nbsp; (This is because of
      the positive nuclei - which prefer one direction of the magnetic field
      over another).&nbsp; Disturbance of the geomagnetic field several days
      before a culture planting also results in enhancing the mirror CPE
      effect.&nbsp; (Disturbing the geomagnetic field provides a &quot;dithering
      magnetic disturbance&quot; in the atomic nuclei which &quot;livens&quot;
      them.&nbsp; Consequently their readiness to charge-up and emit structured
      virtual state charges is increased).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaznacheyev further discovered that
      the Sun's activity and the Earth's magnetic field greatly affected the
      results of his experiments.&nbsp; Large flashes on the sun seem to inhibit
      the effect.&nbsp; (Such flashes cause substantially increased irradiation
      of the atomic nuclei by sun-emitted substructures, charging them mostly
      with this disordered substructure pattern and literally
      &quot;burying&quot; the disease structure several decibels below
      it.)&nbsp; In a season of active sunspots, the mirror CPE effect becomes
      highly unstable.&nbsp; (The sun emissions are sporadically jamming the
      effect.)&nbsp; Under active sun conditions, the effect varies from 90-100%
      on some days to complete absence on others.</font>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b><a name="Some Biological Warfare Implications">Some Biological Warfare Implications</a></b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The Soviets reported detecting
      near-ultraviolet photons - bio- luminescence - as carriers of the
      death/disease pattern.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, scientists at the University of
      Marburg in West Germany also duplicated the effect in the infrared.&nbsp;
      This shows that bioluminescent photons in the near UV and in the IR can
      definitely carry &quot;disease and death&quot; information between
      cells.&nbsp; Further, integrating a continuing input of such photons
      coherently integrates the disease or death pattern from the virtual state
      into the observable state.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note also that portions of the infrared
      spectrum are a subharmonic of the near ultraviolet.&nbsp; Harmonics are
      well-known in nonlinear oscillator theory, and biological systems are
      filled with nonlinear oscillators.&nbsp; It may be that harmonics and
      subharmonics are directly involved in the death pattern.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, the induction of such &quot;death
      patterns&quot; upon normal electromagnetic carriers is directly
      indicated.&nbsp; For example, modulations covering several octaves in the
      region of 10 gigahertz and above might be constructed that are the
      analogues of some particular cellular disease.&nbsp; This modulation
      pattern could then be added to a common microwave carrier - say in the
      communication band, from 3 to 30 megahertz.&nbsp; Say, that is, to
      something like the giant Soviet Woodpecker &quot;over-the-horizon
      radar&quot; signals as carriers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, a large population could be
      bombarded, even on the other side of the earth, with &quot;death
      photons&quot; whose virtual state substructures carry the particular
      disease pattern.&nbsp; With sufficient</font> <font size="3">time, many of
      the targeted persons would develop the disease.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that, even if the power and/or
      irradiation time is reduced so that the absorbed &quot;death photons&quot;
      are insufficient to actually kindle the disease in the targeted
      population, a heightened change in the substructure of the biopotentials
      of the cells of the targeted persons is still accomplished.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, a precursor pattern - a
      predisposition for that disease - exists in the targeted persons.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>If the actual disease agent is now loosed
      on that population, the agent will be far more infectious and lethal than
      it otherwise would.</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, even diseases which normally do
      not kill or seriously debilitate the infected person can suddenly become
      very lethal agents indeed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Influenza, the common cold, etc. can
      become devastating killers if the exposed population has been
      electromagnetically &quot;pre-conditioned&quot; for enhanced
      susceptibility.</b></font>

      electromagnetically induced, can it not be electromagnetically corrected
      or healed?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one could time-reverse the exact signal
      structure (the information) that kindled the effect, and bombard the
      diseased cells with that reversed pattern, would not the cell deviate back
      to &quot;normal&quot; and be healed?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning question as to whether cellular
      disease conditions can be corrected by time-reversed disease signals must
      certainly have occurred to the Soviet experimenters.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>It is highly significant that they did
      not openly publish those results.</b>*<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have explained in the sections on
      phase conjugation and scalar electromagnetics, there are really two major
      kinds of photons:</font>
  <hr>
      

      <p align="left"><font size="2">*&nbsp; Recent information indicates the
      strong connection of Kaznacheyev with the Institute of Physiology and
      Biophysics and the Frank Institute in Pushkino, just outside
      Moscow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since these institutes are deeply involved in
      microwave and coherent microwave &quot;directed energy&quot; weapons, it
      is highly probable that the Soviets are applying Kaznacheyev's &quot;death
      photons&quot; to microwave weapons -- such as the Woodpecker
      transmitters.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, obviously they would develop phase
      conjugate countermeasure signals as well.</font>
  <hr>

      <p align="left"><font size="3">(1) the &quot;normal&quot; photon carries
      positive energy and positive time.&nbsp; (2) the &quot;time reversed&quot;
      or phase conjugate photon carries negative energy and negative time.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Soviets certainly knew all
      about phase conjugate signals.&nbsp; After all, they discovered and
      developed the effect.&nbsp; We discovered it only from the open Soviet
      scientific literature!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that the &quot;death
      photons&quot; in the mitogenetic radiation emitted by the dying cells are
      ordinary photons.&nbsp; Their virtual state structures (in positive
      observer time) are exact &quot;templates&quot; for the disease pattern.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now suppose we detect the &quot;death
      photons&quot; with a phase conjugator, which by definition will produce a
      time-reversed counterpart to the input signal detected.&nbsp; In other
      words, the death photons are allowed to strike a phase conjugate mirror
      (PCM). Time-reversed counterpart photons - carrying the exact
      time-reversed template of the death pattern - will be created and emitted
      by the PCM.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;These newly emitted photons now carry the
      exact &quot;healing pattern&quot; for that specific &quot;death/disease
      pattern that was received and detected.&quot;</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Further, if we &quot;pump" the phase
      conjugate mirror, we can greatly amplify the output pattern, and hence
      greatly increase the healing pattern!</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one records the pattern of the
      &quot;death photons&quot; for a specific disease, one could of course
      modulate that pattern upon ordinary photons/signals - such as the
      Woodpecker signals - and accomplish disease induction or precursor
      conditioning.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By phase conjugating the pattern of the
      &quot;death photons,&quot; one can produce an exact antidote.&nbsp; One
      can modulate this specific healing pattern upon ordinary photons/signals -
      such as the Woodpecker signals - and accomplish healing induction for that
      specific disease.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In other words, one can create the
      healing pattern - the antidote, if you will, for any biological warfare
      agent.&nbsp; Cancer, leukemia, AIDS, viral diseases, bacterial diseases,
      whatever.&nbsp; One can create the antidote within minutes after the first
      symptoms of the disease or death pattern appear.</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can then simply add the negating
      (healing) signal to power line signals, television and radio signals,
      special transmitters, etc. -</font> <font size="3">and immediately start
      to &quot;administer the antidote&quot; to the irradiated population one
      wishes to protect.&nbsp; <i>Now one can see why the Soviets are so ready
      to expose the entire world to something like AIDS.&nbsp; It doesn't
      represent a real problem to them, the instant they decide to negate it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>So they can devastate the rest of the
      world, with the assurance that their population is safe.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can allow some of their own people to
      develop AIDS - and even some to die of it - as a deception plan to delude
      the West while Western populations are succumbing en masse.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they can snatch their own population
      right back to health, from &quot;the brink of the grave,&quot; so to
      speak.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government must immediately develop the
      same capability.&nbsp; It is straightforward.&nbsp; As weapons and
      counterweapons go, it is enormously cheap.&nbsp; It can be immediately and
      widely implemented.&nbsp; And it can protect our population against AIDS
      or any other biological warfare strike by the Soviet Union.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can save our people from the AIDS knockout
      already un- leashed upon us by the Soviet Union.</font>

      <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First let us
      do that. <i>Then </i>let us negotiate.</font>

      this:&nbsp; <b>You can negotiate with the Russians only from a position of
      strength. If you are weak, they will bury you.</b><br>

      biological warfare counter- measure, we are already as good as dead.</font>

      <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b><a name="Popp's Master Cellular Communication System">Popp's
      Master Cellular Communication System</a></b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Dr. Fritz Albert Popp has already
      discovered and pointed out the &quot;virtual state&quot; master
      communication system that controls all cells in the body, and all their
      functions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on a thesis derived to best fit
      experimental results by Ruth and others, Popp postulates that biological
      systems generally have the capacity to store coherent photons that come
      from the external world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the biosystem is open to
      environmental communication and exchange.</font>

      <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has shown
      that the cell population is in a quasistationary state that is far away
      from thermodynamic equilibrium, as pointed out by Ilya Prigogine.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popp also concludes from his analysis that
      ultraweak photon emission within biological systems can influence chemical
      reactivity.&nbsp; In fact, his analysis strongly implies that &quot;ultraweak&quot;
      photon intensity can regulate the whole cell metabolism and related
      phenomena.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell takes up photons from external
      radiation.&nbsp; This includes both &quot;observable&quot; photons and
      &quot;virtual&quot; photons.&nbsp; Since it stores virtual photons, it
      stores charge, or biopotential changes.&nbsp; Since its stored virtual
      photons may be coherent virtual photons, it effectively
      &quot;polarizes&quot; or structures its stored photon charge, hence its
      biopotential.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell emits &quot;spillage&quot; photons
      - both coherent and incoherent - from its stored potential.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Popp only uses conventional
      &quot;unstructured&quot; photons in his analysis, he shows that, at the
      molecular level, there is a stationary equilibrium, as far as photon
      storage and emission are concerned, between the molecular photon traps,
      the cell population, and the external world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that <i>coherent </i>photon/charge
      inception from the external world can directly and precisely influence the
      cell's biopotential, hence its functioning and control, by information
      input.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Incoherent </i>photon inception, on the
      other hand, can only grossly affect the cell, such as by heating or
      sporadic effects.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his &quot;Photon Storage in Biological
      Systems,&quot; Popp points out the master cellular communication and
      control system as follows:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;The photons which we have measured
      can be seen as a sort of &quot;waste&quot; from a virtual electromagnetic
      field with a high coherence.&nbsp; This field has a tendency to become
      stationary over the whole organism.&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>After additional analysis, he adds:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot; Consequently, biological systems
      must exhibit 'holographic' properties to an extremely high degree.&nbsp;
      The successful trials in</i></font>

      <p align="left"><font size="3"><i>finding 'pictures' of various organs in
      each other organ, such as the ear, the hands, the eyes (acupuncture, iris
      diagnosis) support these conclusions.&nbsp; Our assumption that the entire
      genetic information of the DNA is stationarily delocalized over the body
      in form of genons may be seen as a further striking example. </i>&quot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&quot;From this we can easily deduce that
      pattern recognition, as, for example, repair mechanisms and immunity,
      depends finally on the coherence of the photon field within the
      body.&quot;</i></font>

      <p align="left"><font size="3"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Finally,
      Popp states a most important conclusion:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&quot;...In medicine new aspects have
      developed, and not only for cancer problems.&nbsp; Diseases in general can
      possibly be understood in terms of electromagnetic interactions within the
      organism.&quot;</b></font>

  <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b><a name="Scalar EM Comment on Popp's Communication System">Scalar
      EM Comment on Popp's Communication System</a></b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Popp and his colleagues have produced
      most important work and results indeed.&nbsp; They only need to add the
      impact of the zero-summed/multiplied electromagnetics
      (electrogravitation).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we cover in this book, the biopotential
      of the cell is rooted in the nuclei of the atoms of the cell's constituent
      materials.&nbsp; To be sure, every internal physical structure of the cell
      correspondingly &quot;levels&quot; and structures the biopotential.&nbsp;
      The overall cellular communication system is actually the exchange of "leakage&quot;
      photons - both observable and virtual - throughout the overall
      biopotential of the organism.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, going beyond Popp's work, both the
      biopotential and the leakage photons have extensive, complex internal
      substructures.&nbsp; Leakage and intercommunication occurs laterally at
      all levels of the biopotential, and vertically among cells and
      substructures.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master cellular control system's primary
      electrical conductivity path is not through the electron shells of the
      atoms, but is through the nuclei-to-nuclei scalar EM &quot;biopotential
      levels&quot; pathway.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scalar EM methods, organized signals
      (signals with specific internal nonzero vector EM waves, but which
      externally sum to zero vector resultant E and H fields) can be constructed
      for essentially any specific purpose.&nbsp; This includes
  &quot;killing&quot; a cancer or leukemia cell, destroying a virus, changing
  the DNA, etc.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach can directly reach and manipulate
  all immune and repair system functions.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire biochemistry and functioning of the
  cell - including its genetics - is totally engineerable.&nbsp; The Soviets
  have long known this, and have long since done it.<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a specific &quot;charge
  pattern&quot; of desired specific immunity (antibodies, etc.) can be designed
  and used to &quot;charge up&quot; the nuclei of the biosystem.&nbsp; This
  charge is then maintained by the system to provide permanent immunity.&nbsp;
  Thus one can develop, for example, an &quot;electromagnetic inoculation&quot;
  for AIDS, one for cancers and leukemias, etc.</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the cellular control system is holographic, the
  &quot;charge pattern&quot; of immunity resides in every cell, including the
  blood cells.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injecting a drop of blood from a scalarly
  immunized animal into another non-immune animal carries the scalar EM immunity
  pattern into the new animal.&nbsp; That charge diffuses throughout the overall
  biopotential of the organism, and the charge pattern activates the animal's
  immune system, including causing it to produce antibodies - according to the
  EM-transferred antibody template.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine Priore demonstrated this effect numerous
  times.&nbsp; This was one of the great mysteries that confounded the orthodox
  members of the French Academy of Sciences.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French Academy did not know of scalar
  electromagnetics, the cellular biopotential rooted in atomic nuclei of the
  cellular material, the cytopathogenic effect of mitogenetic radiation from
  diseased and dying cells, phase conjugation, and phase conjugated
  electromagnetic healing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is little wonder they did not comprehend the
  operational healing mechanism of the Bordeaux cancer-curing machine of Antoine
  Priore!</font>
