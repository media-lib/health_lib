<h1>The Cholesterol  Conundrum</h1>

<p class="byline">by Bill Sardi</p>

<p class="smallheadline">Answers may lie in optimizing the LDL:HDL ratio.</p>

<p>In the past decade, Americans have dramatically increased their 
cholesterol awareness. Most people would say a low-fat, low-cholesterol 
diet produces low circulating blood levels of cholesterol and lower 
cholesterol levels in turn reduce the risk of heart disease and 
atherosclerosis and therefore lengthen life span. In fact, scientific 
data do not always confirm these assumptions.</p>

<p>First, a cholesterol primer: Cholesterol is a waxlike fatty substance
 produced in the liver. Cholesterol particles are 
lipoproteins--combinations of fats and proteins that travel in the blood
 and are essential for life. A cholesterol buildup on blood vessel walls
 is a known risk factor for coronary heart disease. Circulating levels 
of cholesterol are measured by its concentration in blood serum and 
expressed in milligrams per deciliter of blood serum (mg/dL).</p>

<p>High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, known as "good" or 
"reverse" cholesterol, carries cholesterol out of arterial walls. The 
prevailing opinion is that HDL levels should be 35 mg/dL minimum and 
preferably exceed 60 mg/dL.</p>

<p>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,  known as "bad" 
cholesterol, carries cholesterol into arterial walls. Doctors like to 
keep LDL cholesterol levels below 130 mg/dL. Scientific evidence 
suggests LDL levels should not exceed HDL levels by more than four to 
five times. So if HDL levels are 60 mg/dL and LDL levels are 180 mg/dL, 
or three times greater than HDL, cholesterol is within the acceptable 
range. However, if LDL cholesterol is 180 mg/dL and HDL is 30 mg/dL, a 
ratio of 6-to-1 LDL to HDL, then there is cause for concern. </p>

<p>Triglycerides are another circulating blood fat. Recent studies suggest triglyceride levels should not exceed 100 mg/dL. </p>

<p>Total cholesterol is a broad measure including all the fractions of 
circulating blood fats. The prevailing opinion is that total cholesterol
 levels less than 200 mg/dL are desirable. </p>

<p>What often goes unreported are the potential harmful effects that can
 result from a reduction of dietary cholesterol and fat. A study of 140 
elderly subjects showed that the risk of clinical depression increased 
threefold with very low total cholesterol levels (less than 160 mg/dL).<sup>1</sup>
 In another study, six men were referred to a clinic for cholesterol 
reduction; four experienced measurable increases in clinical depression.<sup>2</sup>
 Along these lines, low or declining cholesterol profiles below a 
concentration of 4.78 micromoles per liter concentration in blood serum 
vs. 4.78 to 6.21 micromoles per liter are associated with 3.16 times the
 risk of suicide among working-age men.<sup>3 </sup></p>

<p>Attempts to reduce cholesterol usually revolve around dietary fat 
reduction, which may create a whole new set of problems. One study 
involving 20 healthy young adults who switched from a typical American 
40 percent fat diet to a 25 percent fat diet resulted in depressive mood
 changes in just one month.<sup>4</sup> Efforts to reduce dietary fat 
often result in low consumption of essential fats, in particular the 
omega-3 fatty acids required for nervous system maintenance. This may 
explain the mood changes involved with cholesterol reduction.</p>

<p><span class="subheadline">Low Cholesterol and Mortality</span><br>
Lowered total cholesterol can result in health problems more serious 
than mood changes. Very low plasma total cholesterol, less than 160 
mg/dL, has been shown to increase the risk of mortality from lung cancer
 by 1.75 times and 3.29 times among men and women, respectively.<sup>5</sup>
 In a study of 595 coronary heart disease patients, noncardiac death, 
particularly from cancer, was 2.27 times higher among individuals with 
cholesterol levels less than 160 mg/dL. In fact, low total cholesterol 
is associated with high total mortality in patients with coronary heart 
disease.<sup>6</sup> These adverse effects are believed to be related to cholesterol's role in the delivery of antioxidants throughout the body.</p>

<p>Because cholesterol, primarily LDL cholesterol, is the carrier of 
fat-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E (alpha- and gamma-tocopherol)
 and carotenoid pigments such as beta-carotene, lutein and lycopene, any
 reduction in cholesterol results in reduced delivery of these 
antioxidants to tissues. It appears wise to increase consumption of 
antioxidants when attempting to reduce cholesterol.</p>

<p>Cholesterol reduction seems even less prudent for older adults. 
Declining total cholesterol levels in nursing-home patients--losses 
greater than 45 mg/dL per year--increase the odds of mortality by more 
than six times.<sup>7</sup> High total cholesterol or low HDL 
cholesterol have not been important risk factors for mortality from 
coronary heart disease or any other causes among people older than 70.<sup>8</sup>
 Based on this information, there is no reason to believe cholesterol is
 a risk factor in patients older than 75, and cholesterol testing should
 be abandoned.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>Lowering cholesterol levels may reduce the risk of coronary heart 
disease, but do individuals then live longer? Researchers from the 
University of Arkansas in Little Rock performed a Medline search 
encompassing research published between 1966 and 1995. They found that 
reduced circulating blood cholesterol levels drop the coronary heart 
disease incidence but do not necessarily decrease mortality rates. 
Unfortunately, lowering cholesterol also appears to increase the risk 
for cancer, stroke and, oddly enough, coronary heart disease when 
certain medications are used. "The benefits may not outweigh the risks 
in all patients with elevated cholesterol," says researcher K.L. Geurian
 of the Medline study.<sup>10 </sup></p>

<p>Despite this evidence, the National Cholesterol Education Program 
wants to put 30 percent of Americans on cholesterol-lowering dietary and
 lifestyle programs and about 7 percent of the adult population on 
cholesterol-lowering drugs.<sup>11</sup> Fortunately, most American 
physicians, apparently wary of the side effects caused by 
anticholesterol drugs and other undesirable outcomes associated with 
cholesterol reduction, are not likely to follow published guidelines for
 cholesterol control. One study shows that only 44 percent of primary 
care physicians would start a middle-age man with a total cholesterol of
 276 mg/dL on cholesterol-lowering drugs.<sup>12 </sup></p>

<p><span class="subheadline">Raise HDL Instead</span><br>
Blood vessel diseases such as atherosclerosis cannot be fully explained 
by cholesterol. Blood vessel plaques visible on arteriograms do not 
correlate with plasma cholesterol levels.<sup>13</sup> About half the 
U.S. adult population has total cholesterol levels less than 200, which 
is considered desirable. Yet it's a fact that as many heart attacks 
occur among people with total cholesterol levels less than <br>
200 mg/dL as occur among individuals with total cholesterol greater than
 300 mg/dL. This prompted a 1992 National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
panel to suggest that low HDL levels may be responsible. The panel 
suggests HDL levels be kept above <br>
35 mg/dL primarily by weight loss and smoking cessation.<sup>14 </sup>Blood
 plasma exposure to tobacco smoke causes depletion of circulating 
vitamin E, Co-Q10 and a variety of carotenoids--the very antioxidants 
that protect LDL cholesterol from oxidizing or hardening on blood vessel
 walls.<sup>15</sup> About 5 to 10 percent of Americans have low HDL 
levels. Therefore, the focus should be not solely on lowering 
cholesterol but rather on raising HDL cholesterol.</p>

<p>The NIH recommendation to emphasize HDL levels is tardy given that it
 was known as early as 1985 that low HDL is the single strongest 
predictor of coronary heart disease.<sup>16</sup> Researchers suggest 
HDL cholesterol is critical, particularly if the total cholesterol is 
less than 180 mg/dL. Total cholesterol is more predictive at levels 
greater than 250 mg/dL. Low HDL in the absence of elevated LDL is 
correlated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.<sup>17</sup>
 When the level of LDL cholesterol exceeds that of HDL cholesterol by 
more than five times, this ratio is a better predictor of a heart attack
 than total cholesterol, LDL or HDL cholesterol alone.<sup>18</sup> The risk for coronary heart disease is 2.5 times greater when HDL cholesterol levels fall below 35 mg/dL.<sup>19 </sup></p>

<p>Current discussions regarding blood vessel disease now go beyond 
cholesterol and encompass other factors such as homocysteine, an 
undesirable blood protein that increases the risk of strokes and heart 
attacks. The antidote to homocysteine buildup is folic acid, with 
vitamins B6 and B12 playing secondary roles. [For more information, see 
related article on page 500.] Supplementary betaine may lower 
homocysteine by another metabolic pathway in a smaller group of 
individuals who are resistant to B-vitamin therapy.<sup>20 </sup></p>

<p>Hydrogenated fats, also called trans fats, that raise LDL cholesterol
 are also considered risk factors for blood vessel disease. Oxidation, 
or hardening, of LDL cholesterol on blood vessel walls is also a 
recognized factor. Inside the lining of blood vessels, a type of white 
blood cell called a monocyte converts into a lipid-ingesting macrophage 
cell, which, along with smooth muscle cells, accumulates lipids and 
becomes what is called a foam cell. As these lipid-laden cells 
accumulate inside blood vessel walls, they are visually observed as 
fatty streaks. Oxidized LDL cholesterol comprises most of the lipids 
attributed to these plaques, and using antioxidants such as vitamin E 
may prevent this buildup. Viruses, radiation or other inflammatory 
reactions may also hasten cholesterol plaque development.<sup>21</sup> Antioxidants such as vitamin E, selenium, bioflavonoids and carotenoids all protect against cholesterol oxidation.<sup>22 </sup></p>

<p>Newly published data indicate that what once were considered normal 
triglyceride levels may increase coronary heart disease risk. Current 
guidelines published by the National Cholesterol Education Program call 
for triglyceride levels to be less than 200, but a research team from 
the University of Maryland in Baltimore now says the maximum 
triglyceride level should be half that amount. Triglyceride levels 
greater than 100 have been found to increase the risk for a new heart 
attack by 50 percent. Triglyceride levels can be reduced with exercise, 
low-saturated-fat diets, and foods and supplements rich in omega-3 fatty
 acids, such as flaxseed and fish oil.<sup>23</sup></p>

<p><span class="subheadline">Optimizing HDL Cholesterol</span><br>
So how can adults keep their HDL levels high? Natural approaches include diet, lifestyle and food supplements.</p>

<p><b>Low-fat diet: </b>A recently published study suggests that severe 
dietary fat restriction doesn't appear to offer much more benefit than 
moderate dietary fat reduction with regard to protection from heart 
disease. Moderate dietary fat reduction produces optimal benefits. A 
moderate reduction in fat intake (from 36 to 28 percent of daily 
calories) has been found to produce maximum LDL reduction, but further 
fat restriction did not show any significant additional benefit. In 
fact, a very-low-fat diet resulted in increased triglycerides and 
reduced HDL levels, both of which are cardiovascular risk predictors.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p><b>Monosaturated oils: </b>While low-fat diets may undesirably reduce
 HDL levels, incorporating olive and avocado oils into the diet 
significantly reduces the HDL-lowering effect.<sup>25</sup> This confirms the Mediterranean diet's benefits.</p>

<p><b>Dietary cholesterol: </b>Despite efforts to warn consumers away 
from cholesterol-rich foods such as eggs, there is little evidence that 
dietary sources of cholesterol have any significant effect on 
circulating blood fats.<sup>26</sup> The liver appears to down-regulate 
its synthesis of cholesterol as more cholesterol is consumed in the 
diet. Young men who ate up to 14 eggs a week (one egg contains about 250
 mg of cholesterol) did not experience a significant increase in 
cholesterol levels.<sup>27</sup> Egg phobia appears to be unfounded.</p>

<p><b>Soy: </b>Researchers performed a meta- analysis of 38 controlled 
clinical trials and determined that soy consumption significantly 
reduces total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides but only slightly 
raises HDL.<sup>28 </sup>Still, the LDL reduction improved the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio.<sup>25 </sup>Traditional
 fermented soy products such as miso and tempeh have been shown to 
contain greater concentrations of genistein, one isoflavone active 
ingredient, compared with soybeans, soy nuts, soy sprouts, tofu, soy 
flour or soy milk.<sup>29 </sup>However, soy isoflavones can lower 
plasma cholesterol by elevating thyroid hormone levels. Regular soy 
users should be aware of its potential goitrogenic properties. At a 
concentration ranging from 1 to 10 micromoles in blood plasma, soy 
isoflavones may cause undesirable symptoms such as hair loss and 
fatigue, which are characteristic of thyroid disorders.<sup>30 </sup></p>

<p><b>Exercise, diet and weight loss: </b>Probably the most natural and 
reliable way to elevate HDL cholesterol is through exercise and diet. In
 a small study of 32 people, exercise alone did not cause significant 
improvements in weight or cholesterol levels, but when subjects combined
 exercise with a low-saturated-fat diet, they were able to reduce total 
cholesterol and triglycerides.<sup>31 </sup></p>

<p>In another study, 42 obese males followed the American Heart 
Association (AHA) diet, and their total and LDL cholesterol as well as 
triglyceride levels dropped along with HDL levels (HDL by 17 percent). 
When the AHA diet was accompanied by weight loss, there were additional 
drops in cholesterol profiles but a desirable 15 percent increase in 
HDL.<sup>32 </sup></p>

<p>A recent study of 180 postmenopausal women and 197 middle-aged men 
revealed that only when aerobic exercise was added to the daily regimen 
did a low-fat diet produce a significant drop in LDL cholesterol (14.5 
mg/dL in women, 20.0 mg/dL in men).<sup>33 </sup></p>

<p><b>Antioxidants: </b>An LDL cholesterol particle contains about 1,200
 molecules of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are vulnerable to 
oxidation but are protected by about five to 14 molecules of fat-soluble
 antioxidants such as Co-Q10, vitamins C and E and carotenoids.<sup>34</sup>
 Since LDL carries cholesterol into the arterial wall and HDL carries it
 out, oxidation of HDL interferes with this reverse cholesterol 
transport. Fortunately, antioxidant vitamins protect against oxidation.<sup>35</sup> So, for example, high plasma levels of vitamin C help maintain high HDL levels.<sup>36</sup> Vitamin C also spares vitamin E from being oxidized in LDL cholesterol.<sup>37</sup>
 Thus, antioxidant combinations may be more beneficial than single 
supplements. A study of young adults shows that intake of vitamins A, C,
 E and beta-carotene from food supplements, along with other lifestyle 
modifications such as exercise and smoking cessation, is associated with
 higher HDL cholesterol levels.<sup>38</sup> Furthermore, high 
circulating antioxidant levels may produce health benefits that 
cholesterol-lowering drugs have been unable to provide, such as reduced 
mortality. Although circulating levels of antioxidants in middle-aged 
men in 16 European countries were found to vary by a factor of six, the 
vitamin E levels accounted for 62 percent of the future mortality 
predictability.<sup>39 </sup></p>

<p><b>Garlic: </b>A recent study examined the combined effect of garlic 
and omega-3 fatty acids on cholesterol. Garlic powder that provides 
3,000­4,000 mcg allicin appeared to lower total cholesterol by about 9 
to 12 percent, which is comparable to the effect of cholesterol-lowering
 drugs. Another recent and widely publicized study involving only 25 
patients using 10 mg/day of garlic oil did not confirm the previously 
reported cholesterol-lowering properties of garlic.<sup>40 </sup>However,
 it is not the first time garlic has failed to reduce circulating blood 
fats. Despite a few reports that garlic is ineffective at lowering 
cholesterol, an analysis of all published studies suggests that garlic 
is an effective cholesterol-lowering agent.<sup>41 </sup></p>

<p>In a notable study, 8,000 Germans with high cholesterol were placed 
on a low-fat diet and experienced a mild reduction in blood fats. But 
the addition of garlic to the diet reduced cholesterol four times more 
than diet alone.<sup>42</sup> In another study, healthy volunteers were 
given fresh juice squeezed from 50 g of garlic just prior to eating 100 g
 of butter, and there was no increase in serum cholesterol.<sup>43</sup></p>

<p><b>Garlic and omega-3: </b>Omega-3 fatty acids are effective at 
lowering triglycerides; however, omega-3 can raise the LDL cholesterol 
count. The LDL increase vanishes when omega-3 fats are combined with 
garlic. Garlic and omega-3 fish oils appear to work better in tandem 
than they do independently when it comes to optimizing the LDL-to-HDL 
ratio.<sup>44</sup></p>

<p><b>Niacin: </b>Doses of 1,500 mg/day are effective at reducing total 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL. The
 main drawbacks of high doses of niacin are flushing, palpitations and 
worsening of diabetes, gout, hepatitis and peptic ulcers.<sup>45</sup> 
Doses greater than 1,500 mg/day may also result in ocular side effects 
(dry eyes, retinal swelling and loss of eyelashes) and should be 
avoided.<sup>46</sup></p>

<p><b>Minerals: </b>A magnesium deficiency increases LDL cholesterol 
buildup on blood vessel walls. Oral magnesium supplementation in the 
range of 411­548 mg/day improves HDL levels.<sup>47</sup> Low copper 
levels, which can be induced by taking more than 25 mg/day of zinc, may 
increase triglycerides and reduce HDL levels.<sup>48 </sup>Zinc/copper ratios should be monitored.</p>

<p>The current science on cholesterol suggests that low-fat diets may be
 counterproductive, that plunging cholesterol levels may trade blood 
vessel disease for an array of mood and nervous disorders, and that it 
is best to raise HDL "good" cholesterol--because elevating this blood 
fat doesn't just reduce the risk of a heart attack, it reduces mortality
 rates. That's the bottom line when it comes to cholesterol control.</p>
