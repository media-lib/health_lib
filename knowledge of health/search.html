<dc:title>How Age-Damaged Mitochondria Cause Your Cells To Age-Damage You</dc:title>
<dc:description>Free radicals, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in particular, play an important part in aging. These are (usually small) molecules lacking an electron needed for stability; they will steal an electron from the first thing they bump into. Like pulling a cog out from clockwork, stealing an electron from a protein or enzyme is usually not good for the finely-tuned biochemical machinery of our cells. The free radical might be rendered safe in the process, but it has left some form of chaos and damage in its wake. Free radicals are sufficiently dangerous to biochemical machinery that some of our...</dc:description>

But medical revolutions only happen if we all stand up in support of

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_%28chemistry%29">Free radicals</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species">reactive oxygen species (ROS)</a> in particular, play an important part in aging. These are (usually small) molecules lacking an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron">electron</a>
 needed for stability; they will steal an electron from the first thing 
they bump into. Like pulling a cog out from clockwork, stealing an 
electron from a protein or enzyme is usually not good for the 
finely-tuned biochemical machinery of our cells. The free radical might 
be rendered safe in the process, but it has left some form of chaos and 
damage in its wake.</p>

<p>Free radicals are sufficiently dangerous to biochemical machinery that some of our body's defenders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_burst">use bursts of free radicals as a kill mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>Scientists generally concur that accumulated damage throughout the 
body due to free radicals is one important root cause of age-related 
degeneration - but the devil is in the details. The vast, overwhelming 
majority of those free radicals are generated by your own metabolism as 
an unavoidable byproduct. The rate of free radical generation increases 
greatly with age as the basic mechanisms of your of metabolism are 
themselves damaged by the free radicals they created. This is not a 
one-step process, however. I'll try to walk through it at a high level, 
cribbing from the <a href="http://www.eurekah.com/book/680">mitochondrial free radical theory of aging proposed by <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">Aubrey</b> de <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">Grey</b></a> and working its way into general acceptance.</p>

<ul><li>Within each of your cells are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a>, tiny biochemical power plants that convert chemicals from food to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">ATP</a>, the basic fuel molecule used by your cells to provide energy for life.

<p></p></li><li>Mitochondria were once a separate organism that came to 
live in symbiosis with ancestral cells. As such, they brought their own 
DNA to the party; some of it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA">still remains</a> within our mitochondria, separate from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA we carry in </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome">chromosomes</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus">cell nucleus</a>.

<p></p></li><li>Mitochondria have a couple of ways of generating ATP. The more efficient of these methods - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)</a>
 - generates some amount of free radicals as a natural byproduct, and 
requires the proteins coded in the mitochondrial DNA to function. It is 
the predominant way by which healthy cells generate their power.

<p></p></li><li>Free radicals created through OXPHOS within a 
mitochondrion are most likely to damage that mitochondrion; they're very
 reactive, so they won't get far before sabotaging something. The 
components that really matter are (a) a membrane that helps organize the
 movement of various chemicals in the process of generating ATP, and (b)
 the mitochondrial DNA.

<p></p></li><li>Sufficient free radical damage to mitochondrial DNA 
shuts down OXPHOS within that mitochondrion, as the necessary proteins 
can no longer be produced. The mitochondrion switches over to using a 
less efficient method of producing power, one that doesn't produce free 
radicals, but has to run at a much higher rate to produce the same level
 of ATP.

<p></p></li><li>Mitochondria, like most cellular components, are recycled on a regular basis. Components called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome">lysosomes</a>
 are directed around the cell in response to various signals, engulfing 
and breaking down damaged or worn components. After the herd has been 
culled, surviving mitochondria within a cell divide and replicate, much 
like bacteria, to make up the numbers.

<p></p></li><li>The signal to break down a mitochondrion is triggered by
 sufficient damage to its membrane: a sign that it's old, leaky, 
inefficient and needs to be replaced with a shiny new power plant.

<p></p></li><li>BUT: if a mitochondrion has had its DNA damaged to the 
point of stopping OXPHOS, it will no longer be producing free radicals 
that can damage its membrane. So it will never get broken down by a 
lysosome. When the time comes to divide and replicate, it will replicate
 its damaged DNA into new mitochondria. None of those new mitochondria 
will be producing free radicals via OXPHOS, and so will not be recycled 
either.

<p></p></li><li>One DNA-damaged, non-OXPHOS mitochondrion will 
eventually take over the entire mitochondrial population of a cell in 
this way. At that point, the trouble really gets started.

<p></p></li><li>By the time you hit late life, perhaps 1% of your cells 
are in this state of being taken over by non-OXPHOS mitochondria. As for
 any neighborhood or city, it only takes a small proportion of dangerous
 criminals to make life really unpleasant for the rest of us.

<p></p></li><li>Non-OXPHOS mitochondria have the unfortunate effect of depleting a needed molecule used in many cellular processes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide">NAD+</a>.
 This is a carrier molecule in the OXPHOS process, given an electron 
(and turned into NADH in the process) to port between point A and point B
 within the mitochondria. Once the electron is delivered, the NADH 
becomes NAD+ again. But without a working OXPHOS process to return NAD+ 
into circulation, the cell would quickly build up a deadly excess of 
NADH, run out of NAD+ and die.

<p></p></li><li>Fortunately for the cell, and unfortunately for us, 
there is another way to recycle NADH into NAD+. Since NADH is just NAD+ 
with [amongst other things] an electron stuck to it, all the cell has to
 do is export those unwanted electrons.

<blockquote><i>Editing for clarity on 11/22/2009: In the bullet points 
above, I omitted details of the reaction that transforms NAD+ to NADH in
 order to focus on the electron that is ported around. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide">Wikipedia gives an introduction to the full picture</a>,
 which also involves an extra hydrogen atom - NADH is NAD+ with the 
addition of a hydrogen atom (one proton, one electron), and an 
additional electron. Nonetheless, it is the shuttling and exchange of 
electrons that is important here.</i></blockquote>

<p></p></li><li>In a form of chemical waste dumping, this is just what the cell does. Structures on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane">cell membrane</a>
 known as the plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) export electrons from 
NADH, recycling it into NAD+. This process is only very active in cells 
which have been taken over by DNA-damaged, non-OXPHOS mitochondria, but 
their outer surfaces are little hotspots of electron dumping.</li></ul>

<p>What do these electrons do? Well, for one, they combine with oxygen 
molecules - which are abundant in any of our living tissue - to create 
reactive oxygen species (ROS): more free radicals. So you have the Rube 
Goldberg system outlined above whereby a few free radicals have caused a
 cell to become an ongoing, major exporter of free radicals into the 
surrounding environment. These will make life unpleasant for surrounding
 cells, but that is most likely not the real problem. ROS just can't 
travel far enough to explain how a corrupt 1% of our cells can cause a 
large fraction of the difference between being young and being old.</p>

<p>A more likely target for all the newly created ROS is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol">cholesterol</a>. Cholesterols, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein">low-density lipoproteins (LDL)</a>
 are used everywhere in the body and travel widely. If ROS reacts with 
nearby LDL - and there will always be nearby LDL - to form damaged, 
oxidized cholesterol, that damaged cholesterol can then be incorporated 
into and further damage biochemical processes throughout the body. For 
example, its effects on our arteries is well known:</p>

<blockquote><i>In conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized 
LDL particles, especially small LDL particles, cholesterol promotes 
atheroma formation in the walls of arteries, a condition known as 
atherosclerosis, which is the principal cause of coronary heart disease 
and other forms of cardiovascular disease.</i></blockquote>

<p>There are many other ways in which accumulations of oxized 
cholesterol can send biochemical processes awry. This, then, seems to be
 a good candidate for the plausible, systematic method by which a small 
number of cells can work such varied damage upon your entire body.</p>

<p><b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">Aubrey</b> de <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">Grey</b> has <a href="http://www.sens.org/mtmut.htm">proposed an engineering solution to this problem</a>,
 based upon this way of looking at it. That is to go straight to the 
root, and get the OXPHOS process working again by (a) moving 
mitochondrial DNA into the nucleus, and (b) ensuring that the necessary 
proteins can make it from the nucleus back into the mitochondria where 
they are needed.</p>

<blockquote><i>As usual, we're lucky - evolution has done the hardest 
part of this for us already. Mitochondria are very complex -- there are 
about 1000 different proteins in them, each encoded by a different gene.
 But nearly all of those genes are not in the mitochondrion's DNA at 
all! -- they are in the nucleus. The proteins are constructed in the 
cell, outside the mitochondrion, just like all non-mitochondrial 
proteins. Then, a complicated apparatus called the TIM/TOM complex (no 
kidding...) hauls the proteins into the mitochondrion, through the 
membranes that make its surface. Only 13 of the mitochondrion's 
component proteins are encoded by its own DNA. 

</i><p><i>This gives us a wonderful opportunity: rather than fixing 
mitochondrial mutations, we can obviate them. We can make copies of 
those 13 genes, modified in fairly obvious ways so that the TIM/TOM 
machinery will work on them, and put these copies into the chromosomes 
in the nucleus. Then, if and when the mitochondrial DNA gets mutated so 
that one or more of the 13 proteins are no longer being synthesised 
inside the mitochondria, it won't matter -- the mitochondria will be 
getting the same proteins from outside. Since genes in our chromosomes 
are very, very much better protected from mutations than the 
mitochondrial DNA is, we can rely on the chromosomal copies carrying on 
working in very nearly all our cells for much longer than a currently 
normal lifetime.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A great deal of work is needed to make this happen, even with today's
 biotechnology. But if you don't get started, you'll certainly never 
finish! Generous donations to the Methuselah Foundation <a href="http://www.methuselahfoundation.org/index.php?pagename=mitosens">help to fund the first steps in this direction</a>.</p>

	<p>Not to discount <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">Aubrey</b>
 de Grey's contribution, it was Denham Harman who first proposed the 
mitochoncrial theory of aging in 1972.  Harman was the father of the 
free radical theory.  The mouse work has already been done by Bruce Ames
 at the Univ of California Berkeley and mitochondrial antioxidants 
carnitine and lipoic acid were shown to "youthify" old rodents.  The 
bragging right for the first anti-aging pill (carnitine+lipoic) go to 
Dr. Ames, who patented the combo and later made the front cover of 
Reader's Digest.  </p>

<p>In regard to the mitochondria, this is where most of the oxidation is
 generated in living tissue and most of that oxidation is generated by 
iron-induced free radicals.  Lipofuscin (aging pigment) accumulates 
which results in defective mitochondria.  Iron chelators such as 
inositol hexaphosphate (obtained from bran) serve to detoxify the 
mitochondria from iron-induced damage.  </p>

<p>DeGrey's text only furthers the focus on mitochondria and aging, and 
is worthy reading for the astute follower of anti-aging theories.</p>

	<p>Yes; I wasn't intending to imply that the earliest mitochondrial free radical theory originated with de <b style="color: black; background-color: rgb(160, 255, 255);">Grey</b>.
 His contribution was a synthesis of experimental observations and 
results at the time into a modified theory that could explain them all. 
The prevailing alternate view was that progressive damage to the 
mitochondria made them produce ever more free radicals in a feedback 
loop or death spiral; observations in the field clearly contradict that 
theory.</p>

	<p>This article is very informative, but it still raises an amount of questions.</p>

<p>1% of non-oxphos in mitochondria simply doesn't seem sizable. As you 
say, the damage is split between the electrons sent out damaging parts 
in the cell, or cholesterol... but how much would that be, really? 1% of
 mitochondria? Wouldn't you need a lot more?</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm underestimating the rate at which they are produced by 
the 1%, but I still picture most of the cholesterol-damaging free 
radicals to come from the external environment, bacteria, etc. That so 
much could somehow escape the mitochondria and seek out cholesterol 
isn't very easy to picture.</p>

<p>If 1% makes such dramatic changes to humans over time, then would 2%,
 3%, 5%, shorten our lifespans to a mere year or two? Perhaps we could 
do testing for the amount of non-OXPHOS byproducts found in people of 
various ages to figure this out.</p>

	<p>Tyciol: it's not a case of free radicals escaping the mitochondria 
in that 1% of cells. It's that those cells have shifted into a state 
whereby they are generating a vastly greater amount of free radicals at 
their outer surface than the mitochondria ever did internally. </p>

<p>The root cause of that shift in state is the damage of mitochondria 
by free radicals, but the end result is a different engine for 
generating of free radicals - with a larger output and more capable of 
spreading the damage throughout the body.</p>

<p>Such is the theory, in any case.</p>

	<p>So the main bad thing about this is that the membrane is supposed to
 be damaged before the DNA is damaged enough to shut down OXPHOS. I'm 
betting mitochondrial DNA has some backups to prevent this from 
happening, and that free radicals would be oriented towards the membrane
 rather than DNA, otherwise the DNA should be damaged very early in its 
lifespan.</p>

<p>Even so, somehow it happens anyway, but why? What are the odds?</p>

<p>One possible reason for this delay I just now theorized is... perhaps
 there is a limit to the onset of these mitochondrial DNA. I'm not 
certain they would be able to take over an entire cell.</p>

<p>Inside a cell, if the free-radical-expelling non-OXPHOS mitochondria 
continue to replicate, this means that that cell will have more and more
 free radicals. What is in close proximity to a mitochondrion? Other 
mitochondria! By damaging the cellular membranes of other mitochondria, 
they are going to be pushed towards death.</p>

<p>At first I thought "this would just be indiscriminate, and kill an 
equal amount of OXPHOS and non-OXPHOS mitochondria, so it wouldn't upset
 the ratio, but then I realized: it would!</p>

<p>The DNA of a normal mitochondrion won't be as damaged as a 
non-OXPHOS. They are constantly dying off and being replaced, which 
perhaps means the ones with the most damage die faster and the least 
damaged mitochondrion is naturally selected to fulfill the role of 
duplication.</p>

<p>This doesn't stop the takeover of a non-OXPHOS, but it points out the
 idea that they will have accumulated DNA damage prior to OXPHOS 
shutting down. In addition to shutting down OXPHOS, the OXPHOS-produced 
internal free radicals must have also indiscriminately damaged many 
other parts of the mitochondrial DNA, and probably the mitochondrial 
membrane as well, as compared to normal mitochondria which are 
constantly dividing and refreshing their membranes.</p>

<p>This weaker membrane in the non-OXPHOS means that less free radicals 
would be needed to rupture it. This would slightly skew favour in the 
OXPHOS geneline surviving, and the non-OXPHOS geneline being selected 
against.</p>

<p>This wouldn't likely totally eliminate them, but simply slow them 
down a bit. Even if it didn't, as non-OXPHOS approached the majority 
level of mitochondria in a cell, they would have to die off a lot. Also,
 during mitochondrial division there would have to be replication errors
 which eventually messed them up too much to properly replicate.</p>

<p>Of course, this wouldn't really negate the theory: only a small 
amount of non-OXPHOS are needed to cause problems, and this defence 
mechanism I thought up wouldn't kick in until there were way too many, 
as in, you're already dead by that time :p Still, who knows, might come 
in handy later.</p>

	<p>I'm not sure I entirely understand your proposal, but the main point
 in my original proposal back in 1997 is that damage to the 
mitochondrial DNA correlates inversely with damage to the mitochondrial 
membranes. A mitochondrion whose DNA is damaged will normally fail to 
assemble a respiratory chain, so it won't make as much free radicals, so
 it will damage its membrane more slowly than a non-mutant mitochondrion
 does. I proposed that the damage to the membrane is what drives 
mitochondrial destruction (autophagy); thus, mutant mitochondria stay 
out of trouble and proliferate by default.</p>

	<p>Yeah... I think I got confused somewhere writing that. What I meant 
was, the relationship of non-OXPHOS with DNA damage. Once they switch 
over they'll have less free radicals so damage to both DNA and the 
membrane would be slower. But since for some reason damage has been more
 focused towards DNA than the membrane, maybe that means other parts of 
the DNA have been damaged more compared to the OXPHOS which are 
continually dying off and renewing themselves, naturally selecting those
 who have not accumulated damaged DNA.</p>

<p>So what I was wondering is, the nonOXPHOS, perhaps since they have 
accumulated more total DNA damage, maybe the ones required for 
mitochondrial mitosis are also damaged, and then they'll still be around
 but maybe still replicate more slowly on average than the average 
OXPHOS mitochondrion.</p>

<p>Anyway, I barely know what I'm talking about, so I'm going to change 
the subject. I was reading Ray Kurzweil's news and game across this: <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/article/home/36660/" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-scientist.com/article/home/36660/</a></p>

<p>Apparently these are these bacteria that infect a mitochondrion and 
eat it from the inside, killing it offslowly. They said it might just 
happen to damaged or old mitochondria. Do you think there'd be some way 
to target nonOXPHOS ones with these? Like a way of waste disposal.</p>

	<p>There are a few fundamental problems with this hypothesis of 
mitochondrial degradation.  Generation of superoxide by mitochondria is 
part of a neccessary regulatory pathway, particularly in neurons.</p>

<p>Let us consider a motor neuron and how mitochondria number is 
regulated.  Motor neurons can be large, a meter from the cell body in 
the spine to the tippy end of the axon at the muscle.  All the 
mitochondria in that motor neuron are made in the cell body and 
transported out to the tippy end.  When the get "tired", they are 
transported back for disposal at the cell body by autophagy and 
recycling of metals and perhaps other stuff.  How does the cell regulate
 the number of mitochondria?  When the motor neuron is small, so is the 
number of mitochondria.  As the motor neuron extends, the number has to 
increase by 3 orders of magnitude.  The only way mitochondria number can
 be regulated is via feedback control (open loop control simply isn't 
precise enough).  </p>

<p>For that control to occur, there must be a signal that is 
proportional to the metabolic load that each individual mitochondria 
experiences over its lifetime (about 30 days in the CNS in rats).  I 
have suggested that the signal is nitrotyrosine produced in response to 
superoxide generated in response to elevated mitochondria potential.  
Integrated over the mitochondria lifetime, that signal is proportional 
to the metabolic load experienced.</p>

<p>When the mitochondria is recycled during autophagy, the nitrotyrosine
 is converted to a nitrosatively active species, either an RSNO, 
nitrite, or NO, and that NO then initiates and regulates mitochondria 
biogenesis.  </p>

<p>In mitochondria, superoxide is vectorally produced into the inner 
matrix, it is not exported.  In the inner matrix, there is MnSOD, which 
destroys superoxide at near diffusion limited kinetics.  Much faster 
than superoxide damages DNA.  </p>

<p>In neurons, new mitochondria are made in the cell body, migrate out 
to the tippy end by being moved along by ATP powered motors along the 
outside of the axon.  When the mitochondria potential falls, the 
mitochondria is moved to the center of the axon and moved back to the 
cell body for recycling.  The mitochondria can persist for significant 
periods of time with damaged DNA.  They cannot replace damaged 
mitochoondrial proteins, but for the most part, they are pretty 
resistant to oxidative damage (particularly cytochrome c oxidase which 
is very oxidative damage resistant, much more so than is DNA).  </p>

<p>I have started blogging about nitric oxide.  It is nitric oxide that 
sets the ATP setpoint and which regulates cell repair by invoking the 
"rest and relaxation" response.  For the most part, most damage occurs 
during the "fight or flight" state when cells divert ATP from repair to 
current consumption such as "running from a bear".  Inappropriate 
activation of the "fight or flight" ATP conservation pathways is what 
causes essentially all degenerative diseases (in my opinion).  A start 
on that is in this blog on the placebo effect.</p>

	<p>Hey... I love your idea...<br>
I’d like to see more research on this... Have you tested the cells of 
old mouse with caloric-restriction diets to verify that it is 
mitochondrial degeneration only that is killing them? <br>
I think that it might be possible, that in cells with efficient 
autophagy, mitochondrial recycle mechanism is working correctly and 
aging is based on other factors<br>

	<p>In light of what you say about the damage done by free radicals 
produced by the mitochondria and the idea you propose of alleviating 
this by targeting antioxidants into the mitochondria, would say say that
 the antioxidants that we get from our food are worthless? After all, 
there are a number of studies suggesting that fruit and vegetables have 
an important role in opposing several serious illnesses such as cancer. 
I'm thinking especially about the kind of antioxidants that occur in the
 much touted blueberries and broccoli, and other various kinds of fruit,
 berries and vegetables. Even if these antioxidants don't reach the 
mitochondria, they must do some good within the cells or in the 
environment around the cells.</p>

	<p>The account of OXPHOS presented at the start of this skein is 
mistaken about key electrochemical features about NAD and H+ (not NAD+).
  When + is shown, it means an atom or molecule has given up an 
electron, not the other way around.  What is involved in the 
innermembrane space is not oxidation, but the splitting of NADH into NAD
 and H+.  The electron freed goes into the matrix to form hydrogen 
peroxide which is either then captured as ATP, or degenerates, giving 
off heat.  Spontaneous ATP turnover or hydrolysis also results in heat. 
 Hydrogen peroxide is the aqueous from of reduced oxygen, always found 
at the anode of a battery discharging into an electrolytic solution.  
Oxidation does not take place at the anode.  Oxidation is the splitting 
of NADH, and occurs in the innermembrane space.  That means it has an 
extra electron, and does not need to scavenge one.</p>

<p>It has been noted that the F1 rotor of the ATP synthase complex 
rotates counterclockwise with ATP hydrolysis, and clockwise with ATP 
synthesis.  Direction of rotation of the rotor is harmonious with the 
lelf-hand-palm law that describes electrostatic pressure induced by an 
electron that is moving.</p>

<p>In essence the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging is based 
upon a mistake, if it is anything like what is described here.  This in 
itself does not refute the theory.  It merely denies it has any 
foundation in a sound model of electrochemistry that envisions redox 
coupling.  Refutation is not called for when the theory's inconsequence 
for understanding aging and metabolism is the measure of theoretical 
soundness.  So far the theory has resulted in nothing except sales 
pitches for food supplements. It has not allowed aging or metabolism to 
be better understood so that either could be influenced by these very 
food products, unless we were to allow anecdote in the court of science.</p>

 in the Millard Foundation video entitled "Regenerative Medicine: Why 
and When?" says straightaway that there is still a great deal of 
ignorance about the nature of metabolism.  de Grey's hypothesis does 
nothing to dispel this ignorance, and, in fact, compounds it by roiling 
the waters with uninformed accounts of redox activity, and compliance 
with century old life science traditions that hold thermogenesis is a 
part of metabolism.  It is to be expected that he waves off those who 
want to do anything about aging by studying metabolism, and directs them
 to engineering strategies designed to fight an expensive rear guard 
action that few could afford even if they worked.</p>
