			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><strong>Knowledge of Health, Inc. Blog- February 1, 2008:</strong>
Edward Mellanby discovered vitamin D in 1922, four years following the
worldwide flu pandemic that killed an estimated 50 million people
worldwide. A retrospective analysis of flu-related mortality occurring
in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1918 reveals a summer variety of the flu that
year that produced a far lower mortality rate, 0.3%, compared with 2.3%
in autumn, an 8 times difference. [The Journal of Infectious Diseases
2008;197:270–278] It would later be discovered that vitamin D boosts
human immunity, elevating the volume and activity of neutrophils, white
blood cells that are the first responders to invading pathogenic
microbes. Did solar-produced vitamin D protect Danes in summer from
this virulent strain of the flu virus that swept the globe later that
year? Or was the virulence of the 1918 flu virus actually determined by
unusually low vitamin D levels in human populations that year? There
were unusual climate changes in the world in 1918. It snowed in Buenos
Aires in June of that year. There is unusual weather again in 2008 with
snow in Baghdad and Jerusalem and cold weather in Southern China that
has crippled auto and rail travel there. Will a flu pandemic follow?<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/influenza.html">influenza</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/Vitamin%20D.html">Vitamin D</a></p>

			<div style="clear: both;"></div><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="ti"><b style=""></b>There
is growing intrigue surrounding the work of Zheng Cui MD, PhD, the
pathologist at Wake Forest University who announced in 2003 that his
laboratory had found: (a) a totally cancer-proof mouse; (b) bred this
mouse to produce 800 totally cancer-resistant offspring; (c) failed to
conduct a follow-up study, as promised, that would identify the single
gene that produced this unusual immunity (mice and human share about
95% of the same genes), (d) identified neutrophils, a type of white
blood cell, as being primarily responsible for this unusual immunity
against cancer; (e) then announced his laboratory had conducted an
unpublished human study and found some people exhibit the same complete
cancer resistance as the mice in his laboratory, and that (f) his lab
had gained FDA approval to conduct a human study in the summer of 2008
where white blood cells from cancer resistant humans would be infused
into the veins of cancer patients.<br></span></p>&lt;<a href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/executelink.asp?story=Cancer%20Treatment%20Intrigue%20Neutrophil%20Infusion%20Therapy">MORE</a>&gt;<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/cancer.html">cancer</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/immunity.html">immunity</a></p>

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div>Knowledge of Health Blog- January 24, 2008:<br><strong></strong><br><strong>The FDA Stamps Out 2,500 Deformed Babies Like This Every Year<br></strong><br>Vitamin deficiency horror story continues as FDA stymies preventive measures<br><br>By Bill Sardi<br><br>Professor
Emeritus Philip Rudnick PhD, Chemistry, West Chester University of
Pennsylvania, has created a time line (below) of the preventable
tragedy that strikes American families an estimated 2500 times a year.
The shocking photograph above is what a newborn spina bifida baby looks
like because its mother did not have adequate folic acid levels at the
time of conception.<br><br>While there are efforts to encourage fertile
women to take folic acid supplements, these efforts are not working.
Only food fortification will adequately prevent this ongoing tragedy.
For the past 31 years health authorities have known that folic acid
deficiency leads to severe birth defects. In that time, an estimated
75,000 American babies have been born with horrible, yet preventable,
birth defects.<br><br>The preventive measure consists of adding less
than 1 milligram (700 micrograms) of folic acid to foods that fertile
women commonly consume, like grains and flour that have been stripped
of this essential nutrient. The nutrient stripping is allowed, its
replacement is forbidden!<br><br>Dr. Rudnick points out in 1991 the FDA
flatly denied that a vitamin deficiency is responsible for these birth
defects, then later declared in expert fashion that they had to protect
the population at large from folic acid masking symptoms of a vitamin
B12 deficiency and therefore could not take action. The thousands of
malformed babies continued to be born.<br><br>What the FDA is talking
about is that, largely among senior adults, many whom are vitamin B12
deficient, symptoms of B12 deficiency (a condition called pernicious
anemia) would be hidden if folic acid were to be fortified in foods
alone. OK, let's add B12 to the foods too since about 40% of senior
Americans are overtly deficient. Nothing doing says the FDA. Let senior
Americans suffer with short-term memory loss, burning feet, fatigue,
back aches, the typical symptoms of B12 deficiency, rather than prevent
these problems altogether.<br><br>Emory University epidemiologist
Godfrey Oakley, who in 2002 openly declared in the British Medical
Journal that any government that did not fortify its foods with
adequate amounts of folic acid was committing public health malpractice
( <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7350/1348">www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7350/1348</a> ), has led the charge to urge the FDA to take timely action.<br><br>A timeline of Dr. Godfrey’s efforts to influence the FDA to take action is provided at this Emory University webpage:  <a href="http://www.whsc.emory.edu/_pubs/ph/spring01/epi.html">www.whsc.emory.edu/_pubs/ph/spring01/epi.html</a> )<br><br>A PBS interview with Dr. Godfrey can also be found online here:  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec02/spinabifida_oakley.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec02/spinabifida_oakley.html</a> <br><br>Despite this publicity, the FDA has not taken timely and forceful action.  The malformed babies continue to be born.<br><br>Now
the FDA has drummed up yet another reason for continue its foot
dragging. It says when it began to increase the amount of folic acid in
foods the rate of colon cancer rose. However, the amount of folic acid
fortified in foods was equal to that provided in the 5-7 servings of
fruits and vegetables recommended by the National Cancer Institute. The
FDA reticence to take action amounts to stone-walling.<br><br>A
percentage of adults don’t even metabolize folic acid properly and need
more, not less, of this vitamin. Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of
California at Berkeley notes that DNA cannot be adequately repaired
without sufficient folic acid and that such a deficiency may promote
cancer. The FDA has deaf ears to these arguments.<br><br>No only would
folic acid food fortification at the 700 microgram level avert birth
defects, it would likely inhibit Human papilloma virus infections that
are known to cause cervical cancer among women. A shortage of folic
acid has also been linked to senile dementia (Alzheimer’s disease).
Somehow in America the FDA has permitted foods to be laced with
hydrogenated fats, MSG and aspartame, but not sufficient amounts of
folic acid.<br><br>Without top-down reform starting from the Executive
branch of government, don’t anticipate Congressional committees to
reform the FDA. Problems like these are too long-standing to believe
anything but pretend reforms will be evident anytime soon.<br><br>Dr. Rudnick’s timeline with commentary is presented below:<br><br><strong>The FDA declares that folic acid does not prevent birth defects among high-risk women<br></strong><br>Philip Rudnick, PhD Professor Emeritus, Chemistry West Chester University of Pennsylvania.<br><br><strong>1976-1996<br></strong>Folic
Acid, Neural-Tube Defects and the Unborn Children Permanently Maimed by
FDA Officials With “…nutritional policy from prehistoric times”:<br><br>A Medline search of the words:  [folic neural tube defects] yields 1464 citations.<br><br>The first Medline citation on the association of neural tube defects and folic acid deficiency dates from 1976:<br><br>Vitamin deficiencies and neural tube defects.<br>Smithells RW, Sheppard S, Schorah CJ.<br>Archives Diseases Childhood 1976 Dec;51(12):944-50.<br>Abstract:<br><em>"Serum

saturation index, and serum vitamin A were determined during the first
trimester of pregnancy in over 900 cases. For each of these there was a

significantly from other classes, except for serum folate. In 6 mothers
who gave birth to infants with neural tube defects, first trimester
serum folate, red cell folate, white blood cell vitamin C, and
riboflavin values were lower than in controls. In spite of small
numbers the differences were significant for red cell folate and white
blood cell vitamin C. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis
that nutritional deficiencies are significant in the causation of
congenital defects of the neural tube in man."<br></em><br><strong>In 1980:</strong><br><strong>Possible prevention of neural-tube defects by periconceptional vitamin supplementation.<br></strong>Smithells RW, Sheppard S, Schorah CJ, Seller MJ, Nevin NC, Harris R, Read AP, Fielding DW.<br>Lancet. 1980 Feb 16;1(8164):339-40.<br><em>“Women
who had previously given birth to one or more infants with a
neural-tube defect (NTD) were recruited into a trial of
periconceptional multivitamin supplementation. 1 of 178 infants/fetuses
of fully supplemented mothers (0.6%) had an NTD, compared with 13 of
260 infants/fetuses of unsupplemented mothers (5.0%).”</em> [8-fold increase]<br><br>In
the years following the Smithells 1980 Lancet paper, despite
additional, corroborating evidence of a folate-neural-tube-defect link
and appeals to the FDA by numerous health practitioners and
organizations, the FDA remained adamant - it would allow the stripping
of folic acid from grains through food processing, but would forbid its
reintroduction in grain products at a level needed to prevent spina
bifida in unborn children. It also forbid folic acid in vitamin
supplements at such preventive levels. Over a span of the next 16
years, FDA officials first used one spurious argument, and when that
collapsed succeeded it by a different spurious one, to rationalize
their refusal to allow the fortification of grains or supplements with
folic acid. Their first stance was simply to deny any link between
folic acid deficiency and neural tube defects.<br><br><strong>Fall 1991:</strong>
The FDA declares that folic acid does not prevent birth defects among
high-risk women… November 1991: The FDA asks CDC officials to sign off
on a statement in the Federal Register to read "Folic acid does not
prevent spina bifida. The CDC declines.<br><br>When this stance proved
hopelessly untenable for them, they retreated to a different argument -
the hypothetical masking of undiagnosed pernicious anemia in the
elderly by folic acid. These officials could have guided their actions
by the Precautionary Principle, calling for the fortification of grains
with both folic acid and B-12. This would have addressed the need to
treat both undiagnosed pernicious anemia in the elderly and the
neural-tube-risk of pregnant women. Instead they took a surreal tack -
the concomitant disallowance of fortification of grains with B-12. Then
- Alice in Wonderland – they used their own tack on B-12 as a basis for
their new argument for not fortifying grains with folic acid, viz., the
specter of masking pernicious anemia with folic acid alone, in the
absence of B-12! Obsessively adhering to their anti-nutrition mindset,
these top FDA officials, employing this Catch-22 ploy of obstruction,
continued to disregard the plight of at-risk unborn children and ended
up crippling thousands of them.<br><br>To this day, FDA officials have
continued to play their anti-nutrition cards on this subject. When,
after years of denial, they were finally forced to admit both a
neural-tube-defect-folate link and the need for folate fortification,
they then acted as oracular authorities on the suddenly obvious
benefits of folate, issuing a proclamation of omniscience that an
intake of 0.4mg folate was sufficient for preventing neural tube
defects, but that supplementation with more than 0.4mg folate was both
of no benefit and not allowed.<br><br>Godfrey Oakley: A FLAMING FAILURE<br><em>
“…when the fortification decision was made, it wasn't made to give
women of reproductive age enough folic acid, so the fortification gives
the average woman only one fourth of what is recommended by the Public
Health Service and by the Institute of Medicine…To me, the guilt
belongs at the doorstep of the commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration. Whoever is sitting in that job can this minute solve
the problem for the whole country by changing one thing: The
concentration of folic acid required in enriched cereal grains should
be about 700 mcg, or five times what it currently is… due to human
stupidity, roadblocks are set up…It is nutritional policy from
prehistoric times that is keeping this important fortification from
taking place… the policy on folic acid is a flaming failure leading to
an epidemic of birth defects we don't need to have... the Institute [of
Medicine] provided cover for the FDA to add B12 to bread which people
over 50 need, and the FDA hasn't moved on that, either.”<br></em><br>The victims of the FDA folic-acid ban?<br>The children with preventable spina bifida born over the period 1980-1996.<br><br><em>
“According to David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D, Director, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [1990-93], CDC estimates that there are
approximately 4,000 pregnancies each year, including 2,500 live births,
affected by spina bifida and other neural tube birth defects.”<br></em><br>Even
if just 50% of these cases could have been prevented by folic acid,
this leaves a toll of 32,000 children afflicted with spina bifida over
the 16-year period 1980-1996 which could have been prevented by folic
acid fortification of food.<br><br>The top officials of the FDA are
responsible for more than 32,000 cases of nutritionally-preventable
neural tube defects in unborn children covering a period of sixteen
years.<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/FDA.html">FDA</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/folic%20acid.html">folic acid</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/spina%20bifida.html">spina bifida</a></p>

			 	<h1 class="title">How modern medicine failed to save John Ritter</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><strong>Knowledge of Health, Inc. Blog – January 24, 2008:</strong>
You are comic actor John Ritter. You have a contract worth millions of
dollars for a new TV episode. You can afford the best medical care in
the world. In 2001 Ritter undergoes a total body scan, which reveals no
problems. Actually, he has an enlarged aorta, the first blood vessel
outside the heart. It goes undetected. On a TV set in 2003, Ritter
becomes nauseated and experiences chest pain. He is rushed to a leading
medical center. Blood tests and a chest x-ray were ordered, and
prescribed aspirin and anti-nausea medication. This treatment was
inappropriate. The chest x-ray never performed. A cardiologist,
applying cook-book medicine, assumes Ritter has had a heart attack, a
blockage of any of the four coronary arteries that supply the heart
with oxygenated blood, and prepares for angioplasty, opening of the
coronary arteries by advancing a catheter with an inflatable balloon at
the tip. In the middle of the procedure doctors find an aortic
dissection – Ritter’s aorta is torn. They can’t save him. <br><br>Had
the chest x-ray been performed, doctors would have seen the aortic
rupture and Ritter would have been rushed for open chest surgery to
repair the aortic tear. Ritter dies at age 54. At the time, many
friends said <em>“only the good die young.” </em><br><br>The medical
center that treated him has already paid his family $14 million. But
his wife says Ritter’s pending legal claims against the doctor’s that
treated him are not about money, but about what could happen to them
under the same circumstances. <br><br>The doctors claim Ritter was doomed by his own biology.  But he wasn’t born with this defect.   One cardiologist said: <em>"I really, really believe that for whatever reason, John Ritter's time was up."</em>
Defense attorneys say Ritter’s outcome was unavoidable. A month later
state regulators fined the hospital for lapses in care. <br><br>If
John Ritter were any unknown 54-year old middle-aged male, the whole
episode would likely have been swept under the rug. How many times does
this happen, Ritter’s wife asks. <br><br>One recent published study
showed 90% of aortic dissection patients survive surgery and up to 60%
live another 10 years. [Heart Lung Circulation 2006 Apr;15(2):105-12]
In another study, there were no deaths among 40 patients who underwent
surgery for aortic dissection. [European Journal Cardiothoracic Surgery
2008 Feb; 33(2):152-6] These were planned, not emergent surgical cases.
But they do show if Ritter’s condition had been diagnosed in 2001 or
2003 he might be alive today. <br><br>Smoking increases the risk for
aortic rupture because it depletes the body of vitamin C which is
needed to make collagen. [Circulation Journal 2007 Aug; 71(8):1173-80]
It is not known if Ritter was a smoker, but like most Americans, he was
likely vitamin C deficient. No, Ritter’s biology was not flawed, just
his nutrition. – Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health, Inc.<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/Heart%20health.html">Heart health</a></p>

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span>How
did we end up with such god-awful food? We have food fortified with
hydrogenated fats, aspartame, high-fructose corn syrup and MSG, that is
over-sodiumized and over sugarized, but lacking in essential omega-3
oils, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B12 and other essential
nutrients which Americans exhibit massive deficiencies. Human have a
vulnerability. Their taste buds rule, and the food purveyors are all
vying for your taste buds so you will select and eat more and more of
their products. A walk in a food store advertised as <em>"healthy"</em>
finds cookies sweetened with aspartame. I told the manager their
natural dog biscuits were healthier. Their red meat was advertised as<em> "grain fed,"</em>
the very practice that over-fattens beef with saturated fat and
eliminates any omega-3 fat. Ginger snaps, on special, but still laced
with hydrogenated fats. Why was I shopping in this healthy choice food
store? I can expect this junk food at convenience stores, but here?
Looking in food baskets of customers in the store the pomegranates,
onions, garlic, asparagus, foods that fortunately can't be ruined, are
being passed over for natural potato chips and bottles of cheap wine.
Yes, even wine is being ruined by aging it for 4 weeks and bottling it,
rather than aging the wine for 2-3 years to maximize the polyphenolic
antioxidants. Years ago a fast-food king, Colonel Sanders, found that
pressure-cookers would inject herbs and spices into chicken, making it
the best-tasting chicken ever. But Colonel Sanders' successors ditched
the pressure cookers, and the Colonel's chicken flavor is now only a
memory. What have we done with our foods? We now have lousy tasting
apples, and tomatoes. Food doesn't even taste good any longer.

			<div style="clear: both;"></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><b style="">Book Review:<span style="">  </span>The Vitamin D Cure,</b> by James E. Dowd MD  (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008) 247 pages, indexed).<span style="">  </span>A
flurry of positive news reports have already been published about
vitamin D to start 2008, and there is no better timing for a good book
on this rediscovered vitamin/hormone.<span style="">  </span>Dr. James E. Dowd, an Associated Professor of  Medicine at <st1:place st="on"><st1:placename st="on">Michigan</st1:placename> <st1:placetype st="on">State</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>, chronicles his personal and  professional discoveries about vitamin D in this practical 247-page book.<span style="">  </span>Dr. Dowd moved from sunny <st1:state st="on">Texas</st1:state> to cloudy <st1:state st="on"><st1:place st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:state> and began to experience joint  stiffness in the springtime.<span style="">  </span>He  personally knows what it’s like when his vitamin D-tank is empty.<span style="">  </span>He now avidly writes prescriptions for his  patients, virtually whom are vitamin D-deficient in the wintertime.<span style="">  </span><br><br>The
book is loaded with practical checklists of symptoms of deficiency and
scoring sheets to determine the amount of vitamin D obtained from
sunlight at different geographical locations within the <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">   </span>Dr.
Dowd suggests everyone aim of a blood level of vitamin D between 50-70
(most Americans are 35 and below), or suggests intake from dietary
supplements be based upon weight (20-25 international units per pound
of body weight), or 5780 IU for a 170-pound adult.<span style="">   </span>That’s a lot of vitamin D pills if taking the 400 IU capsules.<span style="">  </span></span></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"> </span></span></o:p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If
the book gets a bit weak in its message is when it covers the many
diseases prevented or cured by vitamin D, but is a bit short on
suggestions for oral therapeutic dosage. <span style=""> </span>It also creates an impression that vitamin D  toxicity is possible with dietary supplementation.<span style="">  </span>Massive
oral doses (over 1 million IU) consumed mistakenly have not led to any
deaths and the effects of overdose are completely reversible.<span style="">  </span><span style=""> </span></span></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"> </span></span></o:p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If Dr. Dowd does drift into a cloudy area it’s his  suggestion to eat a low-acid diet to conquer vitamin D deficiency.<span style="">  </span>This is asserted in the book without  scientific substantiation.<span style="">  </span>Dr. Dowd  relies heavily on other experts here and they may have led him astray a  bit.<span style="">  </span>Alkaline
minerals, such as calcium, potassium and magnesium are recommended, but
these are absorbed better in an acidic stomach.<span style="">  </span>Not
only does the stomach make its own acid, but acid-forming bacteria
(acidophilus) line the stomach as a defense against germs that enter
with food.<span style="">  </span>About a third of senior Americans
make marginal amounts of stomach acid, which can lead to nutrient
malabsorption and frequent gastric infections.<span style="">  </span>It’s
difficult to fathom just how the diet influences blood pH
(acid-alkaline balance) when blood pH is automatically controlled
within a very narrow neutral pH range (7.35-7.45).<span style="">  </span>If
food could alter blood pH significantly, humans would constantly be at
the hospital emergency room receiving treatment for acidosis or
alkalosis.<span style="">  </span></span></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"> </span></span></o:p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The
claim is often made that calcium and magnesium are released from bones
to maintain a neutral pH state of the blood, but this would mean that
people who eat acidic foods would develop osteoporosis before others
who consume more alkaline foods.<span style="">  </span>In  fact, bone loss with advancing age is strongly linked to loss of sex hormones  (estrogen, testosterone), not pH.<span style="">   </span></span></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"> </span></span></o:p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The dietary recommendations in the book are so confusing,  this chapter needs to be passed over.<span style="">   </span>The
book suggests readers avoid whole grains while every study on the
subject shows whole grain consumption improves health and lowers
mortality rates.<span style="">  </span></span></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"> </span></span></o:p></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">But
then again, it’s difficult to become too critical of a book whose
author is breaking ranks within organized medicine to write about a
dietary supplement that is destined to lower overall mortality rates,
vanquish cancer and heart disease and become an important weapon
against infection.<span style="">  </span>All the Americans need do is start taking  vitamin D pills.<span style="">  </span>Dr. Dowd’s book will  certainly get more Americans to think about this simple, economical approach to  preventive medicine.<span style="">  </span>– Bill Sardi,  Knowledge of Health, Inc. </span></span></p><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/The%20Vitamin%20D.html">The Vitamin D</a></p>

			 	<h1 class="title">Drug companies submit only positive studies</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span style="font-variant: normal; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-family: times new roman,times,serif; font-size: 12px;"><span class="aTime"><span><span style="font-size: 100%;">A
report published in The Wall Street Journal reveals how drug companies
submitted for publication in medical journals positive studies
involving antidepressant drugs, but only submitted to the FDA, and did
not submit negative studies for publication. The results of the studies
are published at a Federal government website, but doctors would not
likely have opportunity to review them there, or even have them brought
to their attention for meta-analyses that are published, which gives
doctors an over-all global assessment of drugs like antidepressants. So
researchers at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University stuck their
nose into the basket of unpublished studies and found many
antidepressant drugs are overhyped. Their review shows 37 of 38
positive studies were published in medical journals, but only 14 of the
36 negative studies were published and in 11 of the 14 published
negative studies their authors <em>"mischaracterized the  results and presented a negative study as positive."</em>
[Antidepressants Under Scrutiny Over Efficacy, The Wall Street Journal,
Jan. 17, 2008] The larger revelation here is that the FDA is complicit
in this ruse --- they didn't assail the drug companies for not
submitting negative studies for publication and buried the studies on
government websites to skirt around criticism. They could now say <em>"we weren't hiding anything."</em>
So can the drug companies. These drugs should be pulled off the market.
Again, the FDA is covertly working with the drug companies to the
demise of patients. - Copyright 2008 Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health,

			 	<h1 class="title">The latest revelation in the ongoing cholesterol scam</h1>
			 	
	 			
			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div><div class="timestamp"><span>So
here is the latest revelation in the ongoing cholesterol scam that has
brain-washed Americans into thinking a fat made naturally by the liver
somehow clogs arteries and causes heart disease. If this were true,
people with the healthiest livers that produce more cholesterol would
be the most likely to develop artery disease. So, one drug company,
seeing its anti-cholesterol (liver-toxic) statin drug (Zocor) patent
expire, had to come up with some way to extend its patent life. Ah,
combine it with another useless cholesterol-lowering drug called Zetia
(ezetimibe). Zetia is a drug that inhibits cholesterol absorption from
foods. Zocor interferes with liver production of cholesterol. Vytorin
is a drug that combines both of these cholesterol destroyers. It's not
clear how the FDA approved these two $3-a-day drugs, Zetia in November
2002 and Vytorin in 2004, before they were proven effective. </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>Cholesterol
in the diet only represents about 20% of cholesterol production and
dietary measures to control cholesterol have been met with abject
failure. In mid-life the liver upregulates the production of
cholesterol in an effort to keep humans fertile and virile a bit longer
since sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone) require cholesterol for
their synthesis. Efforts to lower cholesterol in the child-producing
years should produce humans that have difficulty bearing children, so
it is no wonder fertility clinics have sprung up across the nation when
they weren't needed by prior generations. </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>But
to get back to the latest intrigue surrounding cholesterol drugs, a
human clinical study involving over 900 subjects was completed in April
of 2006. Two drug companies conducting the trial were tardy in
releasing results. They were already taking orders for 1 million
prescriptions for these drugs in a single week. Any negative results
from this study could spell financial doom, particularly for one drug
maker that generates 70% of its revenues from its version of this drug.
Sales of Zetia and Vytorin produced $5 billion in sales in 2007. </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>So
the drug companies delayed release of the study results. A year went
by. They promised to release the results. They missed their own
deadline. Finally, on January 14, 2008, two years after completion of
the drug trial, it became known that Zetia and Vytorin didn't work. As
a New York Times article said: <em> "not only did Zetia fail to slow
the accumulation of fatty plaque in the arteries, it actually seemed to
contribute to plaque formation — although by such a small amount that
the finding could have been a result of chance."</em>  </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>Zetia
reduces circulating cholesterol by about 15-20%, statin drugs by
30-45%. But the most powerful statin drugs only prevent a heart attack
in 1 in 70 users, and even then, does not reduce risk for a mortal
heart attack. So just how this drug-combo was going to measurably
reduce the risk for a heart attack should have been in question from
the start of the trial. </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>Over
the two years of the trial, patients who took Zocor alone reduced their
LDL "bad" cholesterol by 41 percent on average, while patients who took
Vytorin (Zetia + Zocor) reduced their cholesterol by 58 percent. Yet
despite the larger cholesterol reduction, patients taking Vytorin
actually had more growth of fatty plaque in their carotid arteries than
those on Zocor. Yikes! Well, don't become too alarmed, cholesterol
represents only 3% of arterial plaque. </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>The
laugher is how cardiologists are covering for this failure. First,
advice has been issued not to stop taking Zetia or Vytorin until
patients obtain advice from their doctors. Second, anticipate the old
drug switcheroo routine. OK, well that didn't work, let's try another
unproven drug combo. How long will this charade last? (Answer: till the
patents on all the cholesterol-lowering drugs expire.) </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>The
FDA initially approved the first anti-cholesterol statin drug, Mevacor,
even though it only modestly reduced circulating cholesterol numbers
and did not reduce mortality. Only recently has the FDA required
cholesterol-drug companies to show their medications actually reduce
artery-narrowing plaque formation, not just the amount of cholesterol
in the blood circulation. </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span> </span></div> <div class="timestamp"><span>Uh,
so what does cause arteries to narrow with advancing age? Well, if
undergoing a CT scan, and your arterial calcium score (calcification
score) is zero, your risk of experiencing a heart attack is zero. Yes,
that glass of calcium-rich milk hardens your coronary arteries.
Cholesterol is soft and waxy and doesn't harden arteries. P.S. Nature
has all the de-calcifying agents: vitamin D, vitamin K, magnesium, IP6
rice bran. #### Copyright 2008 Bill Sardi, Knowledge of Health, Inc.</span></div><div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel="tag" href="http://www.knowledgeofhealth.com/blog/labels/cholesterol.html">cholesterol</a></p>

a person maintain good memory and recall for 115 years? A recent report
published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, documents the case of a
115-year old woman with remarkable preservation of her mental
faculties. A more recent report in the same journal points to a simple
array of B vitamins (25 mg vitamin B6/pyridoxine, 2000 mcg vitamin
B9/folic acid, 400 mcg vitamin B12) which dramatically decreased levels
of beta-amyloid in the blood circulation. Beta amyloid is the plaque
that builds up in the brain with advancing age that is implicated in
Alzheimer's disease. After two years on vitamin therapy, blood levels
of beta amyloid only increased by 4.9%, compared to 18.5% in a group
received an inactive placebo tablet. Elevated blood levels of beta
amyloid is an indicator of the onset of senility. [Neurobiology of

			<br>
			<div style="clear: both;"></div>Researchers
at the California Department of Public Health say autism rates in that
state continue to rise despite the removal of the mercury-containing
preservative thimerosal from most childhood vaccines. Health reporter
Bill Sardi, author of the ebook <em>The Hidden Epidemic ( <a href="http://www.naturalhealthlibrarian.com/">www.naturalhealthlibrarian.com</a>  ),</em>
says this is not surprising --- all data points to autism being an
infectious disease -- not caused by a toxic metal. Autism rates rose
along with childhood asthma and childhood Type I diabetes parallel with
the increase in antibiotic resistance, says Sardi. Vaccines do not use
killed viruses or bacteria, but rather <em>"attenuated"</em> germs
that deliver a little bit of the disease. Very young infants, even
children still in the womb, have no blood-brain barrier to protect the
brain from these microbes, says Sardi. The antidote is to raise the
innate immune system in these children, which can be accomplished with
the use of dietary supplements. Heavy metals like mercury, lead and
iron accelerate the growth of microbes, says Sardi.<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

			<div style="clear: both;"></div><span style="color: black;">In
a building where, upon admission, they confiscate your fish oil and
magnesium pills when you enter because they are fearful they may <i style="">“interfere”</i> with drugs, its no wonder  there are an estimated 370,000 to 750,000 cardiac arrests every year.<span style="">  </span>The heroics you see on TV where a <i style="">“crash cart”</i>
is rolled down a hospital hallway by nurses and doctors might not be
necessary if patients were given essential nutrients that prevent the
heart muscle from going into spasm.<span style="">  </span>But then there is no life and death  drama.<span style="">  </span>And with all the <i style="">“code blue” </i>drills
and equipment checks, often hospitals can’t get the paddles on the
chest of a patient in time to shock the heart back into a normal
rhythm, says a report in the January 3, 2008 New York Times.<span style="">  </span>If
hospitals routinely performed blood tests upon admission, which
measured your omega-3 index, to determine your red blood cell level of
omega-3 oil (the usual omega-3 index is below 4% omega-3 oil in the
blood circulation), and doctors quickly prescribed omega-3 pills to
raise your omega-3 index to above 8%, your risk of sudden cardiac death
would decline by 90%, say doctors in Germany.<span style="">  </span>[MMW Fortschr Medicine, Volume 149, 97-101,  Supplement 3, Sept. 2007]<span style="">  </span>Red blood cell  magnesium levels should also be checked upon hospital admission.<span style="">  </span>A
magnesium deficiency can lead to an influx of calcium into cardiac
muscle cells, forming a burst of free radicals and massive inflammation
that can result in heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest.<span style="">  </span></span>Several
drugs, such as beta blockers and antidepressants, can induce an
increase in an adrenal hormone, norepinephrine, which then causes an
efflux of magnesium from heart muscle and a sudden increase in the
muscular contraction of the heart.<span style="">  </span>[Clinical Calcium Volume 15: 77-83, Nov.  2005]<span style="">  </span>Patients
with planned hospital admissions might ask their doctor if they can
continue taking their fish oil and magnesium pills.<span style="">  </span>It’s a lot better  assurance than the best code blue team can ever offer.<span style="">  </span>–Copyright 2008 Bill Sardi, Knowledge of  Health, Inc.<div style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
