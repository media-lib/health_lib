    <p><b>Oral Hyaluronic Acid: Anti-aging, Skin, Joints and Healing:</b></p>
    <b>
    <p>An Interview with Bill Sardi.</p>
    <p>By Richard A. Passwater, Ph.D.</p>
    </b>
    <p>My interest in oral hyaluronic acid (HA) was first sparked in early 2001 
    by my older son, Richard, Jr. Richard was in contact with Professor Akio 
    Kobayashi of the Biochemistry Department at Osaka University regarding the 
    health benefits of HA. I had been aware of the importance of HA in 
    maintaining the proper viscosity of synovial fluid and vitreous gel of the 
    eye, but the importance of HA to skin smoothness and brain was new to me. It 
    wasn’t a complete surprise, considering that HA is the principal compound in 
    the body for retaining water in connective tissue, skin and some organs, but 
    I hadn’t seen studies demonstrating these health benefits before.</p>
    <p>Over a year ago, I recommended oral HA to a close friend in the 
    veterinary dietary supplements business. A few months ago, my friend showed 
    me several unsolicited letters he has received from his customers. Notice 
    that I said &quot; customers,&quot; but I could have said &quot;users.&quot; Often, it seems 
    that when horse owners find a product that helps their horses, they try the 
    product themselves if they have the same condition. </p>
    <p>One letter reported, &quot;After three and one-half weeks taking your oral HA, 
    I am off my prescription medicine. My hands quit hurting, and the rest of my 
    body followed. Last year, my doctor told me that I was about two years away 
    from knee replacement. Even with my meds, my right knee hurt. All the pain 
    is gone now. My 13-year old German shepherd has stopped dragging her back 
    feet and doesn’t cry at night. She is also off of her meds. My vet started 
    giving HA to his old lab last week and says he was very skeptical, but saw 
    differences the next day. He started taking it himself after seeing the 
    dramatic improvement in his dog.&quot; </p>
    <p>This really got my interest. Knowing that Bill Sardi had just written a 
    book on oral HA, I called Bill to ask him to share some of his research with 
    us. Many readers know Bill from his other health books and articles. Bill is 
    a health journalist and has written numerous books, including <i>The Iron 
    Time Bomb</i>, <i>In Search of the World’s Best Water</i>, <i>Why Babies Die</i>, 
    and his latest book, <i>How To Live 100 Years Without Growing Old</i>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Bill, your book captures your excitement about HA. What 
    aroused your initial interest in oral HA? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: The startling ABC News Prime Time Live TV program (Nov. 2000) 
    in which Connie Chung went to Yuzurihara, Japan (the &quot;village of long life&quot; 
    ) and showed pictures of people who were in their 80’s and 90’s, and who had 
    flawless skin (no wrinkles, no age spots), flexible joints, good eyesight 
    (few wore glasses) and a full head of hair. Some had even habitually worked 
    in the sun much of their lives, smoked tobacco and drunk copious amounts of 
    saki. A World Health Organization (WHO) survey of 990 villages and towns in 
    Japan found Yuzurihara had the oldest population. There are 10 times more 
    people living beyond the age of 80 in Yuzurihara than any place in the 
    United States. This report came on the heels of the WHO announcement that 
    the Japanese live the most disease-free years of any country in the world.
    </p>
    <p>I eventually traveled to Japan to see this for myself. Farmers were still 
    working in their fields into their 70s and 80s and looked like men half 
    their age. One woman in Yuzurihara was in her 90s and had perfect skin, no 
    age spots, no wrinkles whatsoever. This was all confirmed by Dr. Komori, the 
    town doctor. Unlike in other parts of the world where human populations 
    claim to live long but have a difficult time substantiating their claim—like 
    the Hunzas in Eastern Pakistan—the people of Yuzurihara have real birth 
    certificates to prove their longevity. </p>
    <p>These people live an hour and a half north of Tokyo, next to the town of 
    Nishi, on a slope where rice, the traditional staple of Japan, cannot be 
    grown. So they eat root vegetables, fish and low iron foods. This diet helps 
    these people retain HA (the root vegetables themselves provide no HA). </p>
    <p>HA is the naturally produced water-holding molecule in the connective 
    tissue of the body. Just one gram of HA holds about six liters of water. 
    Think of how the skin of very young babies looks—it won’t even create a scar 
    if cut or scratched. That’s what HA acid does. It is nature’s healing agent 
    and scaffolding or &quot;space filler&quot; for the skin, hair, eyes and joints. It 
    also serves as a barrier against disease.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: At what point did you become excited enough about HA to 
    write the book?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: When I began to see it work. The first convincing evidence was 
    when my dog of 17 years, a 10 pound Maltese with arthritis, regained his 
    ability to run up stairs again. Animals don’t know what the placebo effect 
    is. Then my twin brother came to my front door with his knee brace in hand 
    and said he didn’t need it anymore. He had a very bad Baker’s cyst problem 
    from running cross-country races. I could tell there was a difference in my 
    own skin when I shaved. It was now smoother and small nicks from shaving 
    healed right up. These results were observed within two to three weeks. I 
    have since noticed the bounce is back in my legs. In recent years if I 
    jumped three or four feet onto hard pavement my knees would hurt. But now 
    the spring is back in my legs, just as it was when I was younger.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Who should be interested in reading your book?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: Anybody who is going to live past 50 years of age should learn 
    more about HA. There are a lot of claims about anti-aging effects from 
    growth hormone, or this herb or that. There is no question that the loss of 
    HA over time is responsible for the visible signs of aging, wrinkled skin, 
    hair loss, voice changes, diminished eyesight, wear-and-tear, 
    osteoarthritis, yet little is known of this wonderful molecule.</p>
    <p>A remarkable finding is that these visible aging signs can be reversed 
    with oral HA supplements. A 57-year old woman called me from Florida. She 
    works at a golf course. Her knees were painful and &quot;clicked&quot; when she moved. 
    She called to say, after just two weeks of taking 300 mg of daily oral HA, 
    that her knee pain had disappeared, her husband had told her that her facial 
    skin looked better than following two previous plastic surgeries, her hair 
    dresser noted that her hair had begun to grow and was thicker, and, most 
    astonishing of all, she had no need for her reading glasses any longer! 
    Others have written or called to say they had canceled knee operations, 
    their crow’s feet (wrinkles on the temples) had disappeared, and friends 
    began asking if they had undergone plastic surgery. The visible results of 
    oral HA supplementation can sometimes be remarkable and rapid.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: We focus much on the main proteins in skin—collagen and 
    elastin—when we look at skin health. A primary cause of the degeneration of 
    collagen is the decrease in hydrated HA, which supports collagen. This is 
    why skin moisture is so important. Putting moisturizers on the skin surface 
    helps, but this is like using a small Band-Aid on a large cut. Replenishing 
    skin HA is much more important. Drinking plenty of fluids also helps keep 
    the HA hydrated. HA helps keep the collagen intact and smoothes out the skin 
    to prevent wrinkling.</p>
    <p>Are there common foods that are high in HA?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: There was a misconception that since the people in Yuzurihara 
    retained HA because of their diet that others can do the same. One would 
    have to eat that diet throughout life. The diet in Yuzurihara is instructive 
    since the root vegetables and low iron content produced longevity and 
    youthfulness. In Yuzurihara this is attributed to a small sweet-potato-like 
    vegetable called tamaji. Actually, a good example of an equivalent would be 
    Echinacea, which helps to protect and retain HA levels in the body. Other 
    nutrients such as bioflavonoids (quercetin, bilberry, cranberry, green tea, 
    grape seed, others), ferulic acid from Ginkgo biloba and oryzanol in rice 
    bran, as well as IP6 phytic acid, all of which bind to iron and copper and 
    some which inhibit viral replication, help to retain HA levels. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: <b>O</b>ne form of oral HA is derived from rooster combs. 
    I’m not aware of many instances where rooster combs have been dietary 
    staples, but I have come across accounts where during a famine in China, 
    rooster combs were consumed in an effort to get more calories out of 
    chicken, and people noted improved skin health. Soon rooster combs were 
    sought after as a beautifying food. There are reports that Marie Antoinette 
    favored rooster combs for her complexion. Eventually, rooster combs were 
    eaten as a delicacy in France, northern Italy and China. </p>
    <p>Are you aware of any other instance where unusual dietary items rich in 
    HA have been used? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: Well, I know that ancient Egyptians had some rather odd 
    glandulars that they ate as medicines. They ate eyeballs from animals. The 
    eyeball is a very rich source of HA. You might say it was the first HA 
    supplement. Today rooster combs and chicken sternum collagen are sources 
    used to produce oral HA supplements. Also, HA is cultured and produced by a 
    microbial fermentation process. These are all good sources of HA. What 
    distinguishes one form of HA from another is its molecular weight, 
    solubility, dosage and cost. Results are observed much more quickly with 
    daily dosage of 150-300 mg. This dose would be cost prohibitive for some 
    oral forms of HA. Benefits are reported from the use of all the oral HA 
    products. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Are oral HA supplements legal for sale, according to the 
    1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)?</p>
    <p></p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: DSHEA allows structure and function claims. Companies 
    marketing oral HA supplements, and their retailers, can say oral HA helps to 
    create healthy skin, hair, eyes and joints. The manufacturers will have to 
    provide data before they can make claims of a cure for osteoarthritis or 
    other diseases. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: How about the part of DSHEA that stipulates that 
    pre-existing drugs can’t be introduced as new supplements? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: This question arose with red yeast rice used to lower 
    cholesterol. Since the statin drugs are synthetic statin molecules, and 
    statin molecules were also found in red yeast rice, the subject arose as to 
    whether red yeast rice was a drug or a food supplement? (A closer definition 
    would be a nutraceutical, but I’m not sure if the FDA uses that 
    nomenclature.) So, to answer your question, HA has been used in injectable 
    form during eye surgery for over a decade and recently has been used in high 
    molecular weight injected into joints and skin. Does that make oral HA a 
    drug or a dietary supplement? The oral HA products are mostly of low 
    molecular weight. HA in an injectable form ranges from 3 million to 6 
    million daltons molecular weight, while some<font SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    </b></font>oral forms are as low as about<font SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    </b></font>1,500 to 3,000 daltons. A dalton is a unit of mass equal to the 
    mass of a single hydrogen atom. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: I have seen test results of one<b> </b>oral HA supplement 
    that determined it was<font SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000"><b> </b></font>about 
    5,000 daltons. It seems logical that the smaller molecular weight forms of 
    HA are more easily absorbed in the intestines, but that may not be the 
    complete story. Clinical results are what are important.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: By the way, this is the same problem that some of the 
    medicinal mushrooms and Beta glucans have—too high a molecular weight and 
    poor solubility. Some mushrooms and beta glucans have only been demonstrated 
    to work in injectable form. When they are formulated into oral products, 
    they simply aren’t absorbed through the gut. Some doctors question whether 
    oral HA is absorbed, mistakenly believing it is the same high molecular 
    weight molecule as injectable HA.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: When did oral HA supplements become available? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: Oral HA supplements have been available for a number of years, 
    but the manufacturers didn’t know how to market them. They kept bundling 
    them in with or calling them collagen supplements. HA isn’t collagen. Think 
    of cells in the body as bricks and the collagen or connective tissue between 
    cells as the mortar in a brick wall. The HA is the agent that keeps the 
    mortar from drying out and cracking. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: What does the body normally use HA for? Where can it be 
    found in the body? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: HA is the water-holding molecule of the body. It holds water 
    in connective tissues, in between cells. Thus it cushions nerves and ends of 
    bones, provides shape and form to the human eye and skin, and forms a 
    barrier against the spread of disease. It’s interesting to note that the 
    female egg is wrapped in HA and that the male sperm produces hyaluronidase, 
    the enzyme that breaks down HA. Hyaluronidase then permits sperm to invade 
    the egg and enable it to be fertilized. This knowledge opens the door to 
    creating a natural form of birth control. Taking natural hyaluronidase 
    inhibitors in high doses, either by the male or female, might prevent 
    conception. This is unproved—just on the drawing boards, so to speak. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: How does the body make HA? And does this production 
    decrease with age or illness?</p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: HA is naturally produced, a few grams a day, and some is 
    degraded and excreted through the liver. Vitamin C in combination with iron 
    helps to break down HA and creates a healthy turnover of fresh HA every day. 
    Unfiltered sunlight (UV rays), viruses and malignancies can cause 
    accelerated breakdown of HA. For instance, in some cancer patients the HA is 
    being broken down at a rapid rate and this can be used as a marker for 
    bladder cancer. Degraded HA is what clogs the lymph glands and blocks the 
    downstream spread of tumors. </p>
    <p>In very young children with a disease called progeria, HA is excreted in 
    the urine at a rate 17 times that of healthy children. These progeria kids, 
    at age 2 and 3, look like they are old, very old. They have facial wrinkles, 
    they are bald, and they have cataracts. Progeria serves as evidence that 
    aging is not a function of the number of birthdays but a process involving 
    the loss of HA. Lose HA and a person will look old, regardless of his or her 
    birth date. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Seems like it would be more efficient to absorb HA from 
    the diet. How well is oral HA absorbed? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: For quantification, I think the manufacturers of the oral HA 
    supplements are going to have to conduct tracer studies so the absorption 
    and excretion of oral HA can be measured. For now, we are left with 
    observing the changes in the body, some of which are quite visible, 
    particularly in the skin.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Are there any side effects from taking oral HA 
    supplements? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: Yes, there are, though they are not common. First, understand 
    that oral HA causes water to gel up, like Jell-O in the refrigerator. Now if 
    a person were to be dehydrated, or be taking extra doses of a diuretic, he 
    or she might experience a whopping headache due to a rise in blood pressure. 
    This actually happened to a woman who inadvertently doubled up on her water 
    pills and had a hypertensive crisis while taking oral HA. Fortunately, the 
    problem subsided. Patients with high blood pressure on diuretics should be 
    aware and take lower doses of HA, let’s say no more than 150 mg per day, and 
    they must remember to drink water. Many hypertensive patients take oral HA 
    supplements and report no problems. One of the pieces of advice I offer in 
    my book is to not to forget to drink water. HA plus H<sub>2</sub>O is the 
    way it all works. </p>
    <p>Then there are cancer patients who have lymphedema, a condition in which 
    the lymph glands are filled with HA degraded by the tumor and the HA has 
    blocked the drainage from the lymph glands. This results in swelling in the 
    legs. Oral HA would be contraindicated in cancer patients with lymphedema.
    </p>
    <p>Probably, oral HA should be avoided by patients with rheumatoid 
    arthritis, which comprises less than 5% of the cases of arthritis. The 
    classic symptoms of morning stiffness in a rheumatoid arthritis patient are 
    caused by an autoimmune reaction degrading HA during sleep. Upon awakening, 
    the rheumatoid patients find their joints are rigid because they are filled 
    with excessive amounts of degraded HA. Once physical activity and the 
    circulation gets moving, the stiffness disappears. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: What do we know about how well the various sources of HA 
    work? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: All of the oral HA products work. I hesitate to say that one 
    type is superior to another because it may create the false impression that 
    one source is problematic or even undesirable. Manufacturers are often too 
    eager to oversell their products, and in seeking to point out the weaknesses 
    in their competitors’ products, they destroy any interest or demand for the 
    product in general. </p>
    <p>Therefore, I prefer to say that HA is good for the aging body, and you’d 
    better get some. Period. Even higher molecular weight products seem to yield 
    some benefits. To be accurate, HA is a long, thin molecule, which is how it 
    gets its high molecular weight. In simplistic terms, it isn’t a wide 
    molecule, it’s a long one. It is a disaccharide, that is, two sugar-like 
    molecules strung together and repeated over and over. Some manufacturers 
    appear a bit reluctant to reveal their molecular weight for fear it will be 
    used against them. The lowest number is not necessarily superior. It just 
    helps to have low molecular weight material. Someday there will be a study 
    comparing the various sources.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: How does oral HA compare to glucosamine and chondroitin 
    sulfate? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: HA is a double molecule, glucosamine that holds hands with 
    glucuronic acid. Glucosamine (technically in the form of N-acetyl-glucosamine 
    while a constituent of the complex molecule of HA) is only one half of the 
    HA molecule, hence the reason why glucosamine only yields mild benefits for 
    arthritis sufferers who usually have to take it in high doses (1,500 mg) for 
    prolonged periods of time to experience any results. Just 150-300 mg of oral 
    HA will work better and faster at restoring joint health.</p>
    <p>Chondroitin sulfate raises the production of HA in the body. Dr. Lester 
    Morrison, a cardiologist at Loma Linda University in the 1970s, used very 
    high doses of chondroitin sulfate (5,000 mg tapered to 1,500 mg over three 
    or four months) following a heart attack or bouts of angina to successfully 
    rebuild and heal cardiac tissue. Some of these patients also experienced 
    anti-aging benefits, such as renewed hair growth, cancellation of prostate 
    surgery and disappearance of angina. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: I’ve put some basic information about the structure of HA 
    in a box (Page <b>XX) </b>for readers wishing to know more about the 
    biochemistry of HA. How much HA does the body lose each day? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi: </b>The body makes and degrades a few thousand mg of HA per day. 
    With advancing age or disease, the degradation rate is not completely made 
    for up by the rate of synthesis, resulting in what we know as the slow 
    progressive signs of visible aging. Not all HA loss is systemic. HA wears 
    out in localized tissues where there is repetitive use, the knees, the wrist 
    (carpal tunnel), the shoulder, the temporomandibular joint (symptoms of TMJ), 
    or where there is greater exposure to the sun (crow’s feet, shrinkage of the 
    HA gel inside the eyes that leads to vitreous detachment and floaters). </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: What dosage of oral HA do you recommend for various 
    conditions—joints, skin, and so on? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: HA is appropriate for adults, age 40 or 50 and up, or anyone 
    who has worn out HA in a particular area. I had a 32-year old piano mover 
    write to me that he was ready to give up his job and undergo knee surgery. 
    He took oral HA and within a month had no pain. The loss of HA can occur 
    early, depending upon wear and tear. Imagine what oral HA supplements could 
    do to extend the career of athletes. I expect Olympic athletes to be using 
    oral HA soon. Oral dosage should be 150 mg per day, with possibly a loading 
    dose for one month of 300 mg per day. More HA is not always better. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Let’s get back to aging. You mentioned that the aging 
    process results in a loss of hydration due to a loss of HA. How would oral 
    HA help besides making skin look younger? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: I have predicted that oral HA supplements will result in 
    people literally walking out of their wheelchairs. I would like to see actor 
    Christopher Reeve try a course of oral HA. Recall that Reeve suffered 
    paralysis following a horse riding accident. The healing of nerves simply 
    can’t take place adequately without the cushioning provided by HA.</p>
    <p>I also have observed other profound effects of oral HA. For example, as 
    oral HA refills the eyes, it slightly lengthens the front-to-back length of 
    the eye. This means the focus point of the eyes is altered. Therefore, 
    farsighted people who take oral HA supplements may find their vision 
    improving without glasses. Since all adults become a bit farsighted with 
    advancing age, this has enormous possibilities to keep people out of reading 
    glasses. </p>
    <p>Also, the other half of the HA molecule, glucuronic acid, is similar to 
    the food supplement calcium D-glucarate, which helps maintain hormone 
    levels. Many women taking oral HA supplements have reported that their hot 
    flashes and symptoms of menopause have abated with use. This is not 
    surprising. Women have been advised that oral estrogen supplementation 
    doesn’t prevent disease, and may in fact slightly increase the risk of 
    disease. An alternative to estrogen would be oral HA. Why do women have 
    beautiful skin? Because estrogen elevates HA levels in the skin and body. 
    Once natural estrogen production has ceased (menopause), the natural 
    alternative would be oral HA. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: What impact will oral HA make upon the natural products 
    industry? </p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: There is so much hyperbole, so much pseudoscience, among all 
    the natural products now available, it is difficult today to determine the 
    good &quot;waterholes&quot; from the bad ones. Understand, the natural products 
    industry often doesn’t fully understand what it is selling.</p>
    <p>For example, take red yeast rice, which now has been removed from the 
    market by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because it has been 
    declared a drug. Patients sought red yeast rice because they wanted an 
    alternative to the sometimes troublesome statin drugs. But red yeast rice 
    contained statin molecules and posed the same risk for side effects. The 
    industry simply wasn’t helping the public find a good non-toxic alternative 
    when it began selling red yeast rice.</p>
    <p>Similarly, there are a lot of collagen products being marketed for joint 
    health, and they are cause for confusion. Even though Type II collagen 
    accompanies some oral HA products, the collagen is a sideshow. It’s the HA 
    that is doing all the healing. Collagen products promoted for joint health 
    simply aren’t going to produce the results that HA does. Once the industry 
    sorts all this out, there will be a stampede for these HA products. Go into 
    a health food store today and ask about hyaluronic acid. They haven’t a clue 
    what you are talking about. </p>
    <p>There are so many natural products that lay claim to &quot;anti-aging&quot; 
    benefits it is often confusing. There is no argument that the visible signs 
    of aging—baldness, voice change, skin wrinkling and dryness, shrinkage in 
    height, joint pain and dependency upon eyeglasses—all emanate from the loss 
    of HA and not to direct shortages of any hormones like DHEA, or minerals 
    like coral calcium, or any other widely promoted natural remedies. </p>
    <b>
    <p>Passwater</b>: Thanks Bill for sharing this information about HA with us.</p>
    <b>
    <p>Sardi</b>: It’s my pleasure. What I have shared with you here should have

    Understand, just like glucosamine, the demand for oral HA is being led by 
    the public. It is not a doctor-driven revolution. This is probably the way 
    it should be. For readers who want to learn more about HA’s age reversing 
    properties, they might be interested in picking up a copy of my new book <i>
    How to Live 100 Years Without Growing Old</i>, available at <i>

    <p>How and Why HA Promises Benefits</p>
    </b>
    <p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is not a single compound, but a family of similar 
    structures. Let’s start with a brief review of the compounds and 
    nomenclature involved with HA. The monosaccharide glucose, the principal 
    sugar of the body, is the most important carbohydrate in the body. This is 
    true not only because it is the primary fuel for producing energy, but 
    because it is used for building many complex compounds.</p>
    <p>When an amino group is added to glucose, glucosamine is formed. The body 
    uses glucosamine to form several other larger compounds, but when it uses 
    glucosamine this way, an acetyl group is added. Thus, the form of 
    glucosamine found in complex compounds is actually N-acetyl-glucosamine.</p>
    <p>Glucuronic acid is formed from glucose when it is converted into an 
    organic acid by essentially replacing the hydroxyl group on carbon #6 with a 
    carboxylic acid group. Galactose is another monosaccharide. It has almost 
    the same structure as glucose, except that the hydroxyl group on carbon #4 
    points in the opposite direction. Galactosamine is formed with the addition 
    of an amino group. Likewise, in complex molecules, galactose is converted 
    into N-acetyl-glactosamine.</p>
    <p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family, 
    which includes chondroitin sulfate, dermatin sulfate and heparin sulfate. 
    Unlike other members of this family, HA is not bound covalently to proteins. 
    HA is comprised of linear, unbranching, polyanionic disaccharide units 
    consisting of glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-glucosamine joined alternately by 
    beta 1-3 and beta glycosidic bonds. </p>
    <p>Figure 1 (Page <b>XX) </b>shows the chemical structure of HA. The ring 
    structure on the left is glucuronic acid and the ring structure on the right 
    is N-acetyl-glucosamine. The brackets indicate that these two components are 
    repeated &quot; n&quot; times. Thus, HA is not a single compound having a single 
    formula. Technically, any compound where &quot; n&quot; is greater than 10 can be 
    called HA. However, the final synthesis of HA normally produces compounds 
    where &quot; n&quot; can range widely from a few thousand to several million.</p>
    <p>Chondroitin sulfate is a closely related family member, but it doesn’t 
    hold as much water. The structure is similar, but the difference is 
    biochemically significant. In chondroitin sulfate, there is the same 
    glucuronic acid ring, but the other ring is n-acetyl-galatosamine. Chitin is 
    also very similar except that it is basically a polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamine.</p>
